Captain George Vancouver undertook a voyage of the Pacific Ocean from 1791- 1795, where he surveyed a good portion of the coastline of what is now British Columbia. In 1792, Vancouver, deterred by bad weather from continuing the survey, waited securely in Safety Cove. Captain Duncan named Calvert Island, whose name was probably given in honour of the noble house of Baltimore and was retained by Vancouver in 1792.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Calvert Island is situated within the Heiltsuk and Wuikinuxv First Nation territories. The Heiltsuk people lived in many villages and seasonal camp locations throughout their territory, which includes Calvert Island. The Heiltsuk Nation has collected evidence that dates Namu, a village site close to Calvert Island, at approximately 10,000 years old.

Some unusual geological features include Pillar Rock, Beehive Hill and Celestial Bluff. The basaltic formations and mountain ranges like the Cameron Range combined with very wet hypermaritime climate has led to extensive non-forested alpine and wetlands that often extend to the coast.<br><br>There are 18 estuaries in the heritage site/conservancy that spill into some of the most productive marine habitat on Haida Gwaii. This coastline accounts for over 9% of the Herring spawning area (by length of coast) for Haida Gwaii, 35% of the occurrences of kelp forests, and significant eel grass beds. Duu Guusd Heritage Site/Conservancy contains 18% of Haida Gwaii&rsquo;s fish-bearing freshwater, and streams such as Haines, Jalun and Coates are known to host coho salmon, chum salmon, pink salmon, sockeye salmon, Dolly Varden, steelhead, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, stickleback, coastrange sculpin and slimy sculpin.<br>    <br>The area hosts numerous listed species including 73 known Peregrine Falcon nest sites (red listed). Important nesting and foraging habitat can be found within this heritage site/conservancy for northern saw-whet owls (Riley Creek &ndash; blue listed), northern goshawks (<em>Accipiter gentilis laingi</em> &ndash; red listed), marbled murrelets (red listed), ancient murrelet (blue listed), and cassin&rsquo;s auklet (blue listed).<br><br>Eighty-eight recorded archaeological sites contain an impressive number of cultural items. These include at least 491 known culturally modified trees, shell middens, cobble tools, aboriginal logged trees, cambium stripped hemlock, lithics, cultural depressions, canoes, fire broken rock, habitation features, caves, human remains, smokehouses, cedar withes, rock shelters, house depressions, burial sites, burial boxes, burial houses, carved figures and planked trees. Many of these areas have not been inventoried thoroughly which indicates that the heritage site/conservancy likely contains many other unrecorded cultural heritage and archaeological sites.<br>    <br>The cultural heritage values in the heritage site/conservancy include opportunities for the ongoing continuance of Haida culture through traditional use of the area. Some examples of traditional use within Duu Guusd Heritage Site/Conservancy may include monumental cedar and cedar bark harvesting, seaweed harvesting, medicinal plant harvesting, hunting, fishing, trapping and food gathering. The heritage site/conservancy also provides a place for the physical expression of culture through monumental art such as totems or establishment of traditional style infrastructure such as longhouses.<br>    <br>    The remote location of Duu Guusd Heritage Site/Conservancy provides an excellent opportunity to maintain biological diversity and natural environment values. Of concern, though, is the presence of introduced mammals of which raccoons, Norway rats and black-tailed deer pose a threat to local ecosystems. There is also occurrence of sowthistle, a non-native invasive plant, in the heritage site/conservancy.",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>     <li><strong>History:</strong> Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy was designated as a conservancy on July 14, 2006 following recommendations from the North Coast Land and Resource Management Plan. The conservancy provides safe boat anchorages for boaters travelling along the North Coast and good opportunities for recreation activities and wildlife viewing.</li>     <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy lies within the traditional territory of the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation.&nbsp; Members of the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation have lived along the north coast of British Columbia for more than 10,000 years. The territory of the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation extends from <em>Lax Kxeen</em> (Prince Rupert) in the north then south to Princess Royal Island and extends from Hecate Straight in the west then <em>eastward</em> to include the lower reaches of the (Skeena River). Prior to European contact, the Gitxaa&#322;a people lived in villages located throughout the territory. Seasonal campsites were located in strategic locations to facilitate utilization of natural resources. The central home for the Gitxaa&#322;a is now the main village on <em>Lax Klan</em> (Dolphin Island).<br> <br>Gitxaala means &ldquo;people of the salt,&rdquo; which is a reference to the ocean-front location of the Gitxaala community on Dolphin Island. Nii Luutiksm means &ldquo;a special or treasured area.&rdquo; Gitxaala/Kitkatla Inlet provides a wealth of traditional resources that have for millennia sustained the Gitxaa&#322;a. Traditional harvesting of seaweed, roe-on-kelp, cockles and salmon are some of the practices that continue to occur within this inlet. The area&rsquo;s oral history, stone fish-weirs and cache pits within this conservancy represent a history that predates European contact. Protection of cultural uses and values is a dominant feature of this conservancy.<br><br>The traditional hereditary system of governance is one of the main structures of Gitxaa&#322;a society for cultural, economic and political purposes. The <em>Wil &lsquo;na &lsquo;ta&#322;</em> (House Unit), led by a <em>Sm gyigyet</em> (House Chief) has been the primary unit of each village. Each House in turn is affiliated with one of the four Clans: <em><u>G</u>anhada </em>(raven), <em>Gisbutwada</em> (blackfish), <em>Lax Sgyiik</em> (eagle) and <em>Lax Gyibuu</em> (wolf). There are currently 26 house groups within the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation. Each house has the right to use, and the responsibility to manage, specified land within the larger Gitxaa&#322;a Nation traditional territory. Throughout time the entire territory has been occupied, and resources managed and utilized, according to the laws, traditions and customs of the people. Resources were traded between house groups and with other Tsimshian villages. In recent times the Gitxaa&#322;a Government has incorporated an elected Band Council to work with the Hereditary House Chiefs in governing the Gitxaa&#322;a territory.<br><br>The Gitxaa&#322;a Nation continues to respect the allocation of resources, management of the land and cultural use of the land at the House level. Each House leader, Chief, is responsible for management of the land holdings of their House to ensure that the land and natural resources are managed in a manner that will provide for future generations.<br><br>Northern portions of the Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy are of importance and part of the asserted traditional territories of the Coast Tsimshian which includes both the Metlakatla and Lax Kw&rsquo;alaams First Nations. Kwil-Mas (North Porcher Island) is an intensive traditional use area for within the traditional territory of the Gitwylgiots Tribe and of importance for the harvest of roe-on-kelp and other sea resources.<br><br>Use the below links for information or to contact the Gitxaala First Nation:   <ul>  <li><a href=\"http://gitxaalanation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gitxaala Nation</a><br>    PO Box 149 <br>      Kitkatla, BC, V0V 1C0<br>    Phone: 250-848-2214 <br>    Fax: 250-848-2238</li>  <li><u><a href=\"http://www.metlakatla.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Metlakatla Stewardship Office</a></u><br>   P.O.

Gitxaala Inlet is a small inland sea with strong tidal currents ensuring good nutrient exchange. Gitxaala Inlet has a very high habitat rating for waterfowl. Threatened and endangered bird species recorded in these waters include trumpeter swan (overwintering), Brant, long-tailed duck, western grebe, Pacific loon and great blue heron. A large herring spawn occurs in the inlet. A grey whale rubbing beach is also a special feature within this protected area.<br> <br>Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy helps protect the areas biological diversity and natural environments by protecting representative coastal flora and fauna, plant communities and animal species at risk, and special features, particularly lowland coastal muskeg (bogs and fens) and bog forests, limestone features, kelp beds, a highly productive marine ecosystem, the grey whale rubbing beach, a sea lion haul-out, marine invertebrates, and a provincially significant seabird and shorebird feeding and moulting area. Together with nearby Banks Nii Luutiksm and Lax Kul Nii Luutiksm/Bonilla conservancies, Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy protects over 48,000 ha of terrestrial and marine habitats on the outer coast.</li>     <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Black Bears, wolves, waterfowl, eagles, spawning salmon and the occasional deer can be seen in the conservancy. Humpback whales, killer whales, Dall&rsquo;s porpoises, Pacific white-sided dolphins, sea lions and harbour seals can also be seen in the adjacent marine waters.    <ul>    <li><a href=\"/explore/gen_info/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>    </ul>   </li></ul>",

Government. The conservancy was proposed with cooperation between the Haisla Nation and the B.C. Government to protect the largest intact coastal temperate rainforest in the world. The Kitlope was first established as a Protected Area on February 20, 1996. Its designation was later changed from Protected Area to Conservancy on June 27, 2008. The Kitlope area encompasses a rich diversity of natural and cultural heritage values.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The Kitlope Valley lies within the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation. Known to the Haisla as &ldquo;Hushuwashsdu&rdquo; or &ldquo;Source of the milky blue water,&rdquo; the Kitlope area is a focus of native lore and native stories such as &ldquo;The Man Who Turned to Stone.&rdquo; The Kitlope Valley also has significant archaeological site potential. The Haisla have used the Kitlope area for the harvesting of plants, animals and fish including salmon and oolichan.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The area encompasses the world&rsquo;s largest intact coastal temperate rainforest. This unique rainforest has old-growth trees over 800 years old. The Kitlope watershed provides a large intact diversity of wildlife and fish habitats, ranging from estuaries, lakes, rich flood plains, steep side slopes and alpine areas.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The Kitlope Valley is an important habitat for Marbled Murrelets, Bald Eagles, moose, mountain goats, grizzly bear, black bear and waterfowl. A variety of waterfowl and birds can also be found throughout the Kitlope watershed. All five species of pacific salmon, herring,  and oolichan spawn throughout the many rivers and creeks.</li>     </ul>",

In appreciation of the tribes having stood beside them to protect the area, the Gitwilgyoots allocated portions of the islands to other tribes and house groups, such as the Coast Tsimshian, for activities such as harvesting of sea resources, hunting, trapping and camping.<br><br> The islands are important intertidal harvesting area for sam&rsquo; k (clams), gaboox (cockles), galmoos and (crabs), hadani (black cod/sablefish), as well as t&rsquo;ibiin (sealion) and uula (seal) and bilhaa (abalone). Kibaau (seaweed) is particularly important to those who currently camp on the islands.<br><br>Many plants are harvested for medicinal and material purposes. Examples of plants used traditionally include: salmon berries, blueberries, huckleberries, hemlock cambium (inner bark), ha&rsquo;tal (red cedar bark), wal (yellow cedar), luwi (alder tree), sahakwdak (yew), and wooms (devil&rsquo;s club).<br><br>For further information please contact:<ul><li><U><a href=\"http://www.metlakatla.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Metlakatla Stewardship Office</a></U><br>P.O.

The area hosts numerous listed species including 18 known Peregrine falcon (blue-listed) nesting sites, and important foraging habitat for Pelagic cormorants (red-listed), Ancient murrelets (blue-listed), tufted puffins (blue-listed), and marbled murrelets (red-listed). Within this heritage site/conservancy, Northern goshawks (laingi subspecies &ndash; red listed) and marbled murrelets (red listed) may inhabit areas of old-growth forest (>250 years old).<br>     <br>Several archaeological sites contain a number of recorded cultural values. These include at least 12 known culturally modified trees, subsurface shell middens, a habitation cave, a petroform, lithics, human remains and fire broken rock. Many of these areas have not been inventoried thoroughly which indicates that the conservancy likely contains many other unrecorded cultural heritage and archaeological sites.<br>     <br>The cultural heritage values in the heritage site/conservancy include opportunities for the ongoing continuance of Haida culture through traditional use of the area. Some examples of traditional use within <u>K</u>&rsquo;uuna Gwaay Heritage Site/Conservancy may include monumental cedar and cedar bark harvesting, seaweed harvesting, medicinal plant harvesting, hunting, fishing, trapping and food gathering. The heritage site/conservancy also provides a place for the physical expression of culture through monumental art such as totems or establishment of traditional style infrastructure such as longhouses.",

These sites are at the mouth of Pine Creek (a key grayling gathering place) and are important spiritual sites for prayer and cleansing ceremonies. In addition to the trail and archaeological sites, documented Tlingit traditional uses include berry picking, hunting and trapping.</p></li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Monarch Mountain/A Xéegi Deiyi Conservancy lies within the Yukon Southern Lakes Ecoregion. This ecoregion is characterized by a gently rolling upland, with wide valleys separating isolated mountains. In the past, this area was largely covered by glaciers that moved northward off the Boundary Ranges to the southwest where they came into contact with glaciers from the Skeena Mountains.</p><p>The dominant ecosystem in the Monarch Mountain/A Xéegi Deiyi Conservancy is the spruce-willow-birch shrublands. An area of Boreal White and Black Spruce also occurs on the lower slopes on the western side of the conservancy.</p></li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Wildlife diversity in the Monarch Mountain/A Xéegi Deiyi Conservancy is limited by the harsh climate typical of the spruce-willow-birch ecosystem. These high elevation plateaus are not highly used in winter. However, a large variety of wildlife species, including ungulates, large carnivores, small mammals, raptors, song birds, and a host of invertebrate species, use the area in the snow-free months.</p></li><li><a href=\"../../wild_gen.html\">Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li></ul>",

Pictographs on the canyon walls indicate the presence of people long before the Europeans. An historic flume for floating logs to the Adams River from Skmana Lake dates back to the early part of this century. Some of the original timbers that supported the flume are still in place. Adams Lake Lumber (Interfor) employees re-constructed a portion of flume to the original design. It can be viewed above the first bridge in the Huihill trail system. (currently closed, see note above)<br>   <br>Between 1976 and 1986, 46.9 hectares (116 acres) of land along the Adams River was acquired and protected by <br>     <a href=\"http://www.naturetrust.bc.ca/\" target=\"blank\">The Nature Trust of British Columbia</a>, a leading land conservation organization. These properties are still under long-term lease to the BC Ministry of Environment. Though originally named after Roderick Haig-Brown (1908-1976) the conservationist, in 2018, the park was renamed at the request of the Little Shuswap Indian Band to reflect ancestral connections. The new name, \"Ts&uacute;tswecw,\" is the traditional Secwepemc name, and translates to \"many rivers.</li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Ts&uacute;tswecw Provincial Park encompasses a river-eroded landscape with a variety of cultural heritage sites.

The wooded area surrounding the river contains a natural assortment of trees including the Douglas-fir, cottonwood, birch, alder, ponderosa pine, hemlock and cedar. The park is also home to numerous forms of birds and mammals including whitetail and mule deer, black bears, beaver, river otter, mink, bald eagles and osprey. <br><br>Visitors in October, 2018 and every fourth year following will marvel at the spectacle of two million sockeye salmon spawning in the Adams River.

Arctic Lake is located in the headwaters of the Parsnip River that eventually drains into the Arctic Ocean. Portage and Pacific Lakes drain via James Creek into Herrick Creek and the McGregor River, which empties into the Fraser River on the way to the Pacific. This is a unique watershed as water flows to the Pacific and also to the Arctic Ocean.     </p>     <p>      The lakes are a beautiful turquoise colour, and situated in a very scenic area, with alpine peaks and ridges as a distant backdrop. Situated in an area of limestone bedrock, some watercourses drain underground. Valley bottoms alongside the lakes support wet meadows and mixed forest. Valley sides include extensive avalanche chutes and small, picturesque waterfalls.      </p>     <p>      The park protects very high value fall and spring grizzly habitat, and year-round caribou habitat. Lakes and streams support diverse fish populations, and provide excellent opportunities for fishing.

Many of these became weary of travel and were luredaside to discoveries that were easier to reach. The gold rush cameto Atlin Lake country in 1898 and was one of the richest offshootsof the klondike rush. By the end of the mining season of 1899 about5000 people flocked to the region, and Atlin was a busy and importanttown. Although creeks in the present day park must have been prospected,none bore any gold. Although production was greatest in the earlyyears, the Atlin field still produces today.

Acting as an ice dam, the glacier prevented the lake from draining down the Bear River Valley. If enough water collects behind an ice dam, a glacier may begin to float. Water flowing under the ice quickly creates a large tunnel. The lake empties, the ice dam resettles, and water again begins to collect until another flood is triggered. Five times between 1958 and 1962 Strohn Lake emptied underneath its ice dam in a catastrophic tumult of muddy water, rock and ice. This type of flood is known by the Icelandic term &ldquo;jokulhlaup.&rdquo; In 1967, Bear Glacier melted away from the valley wall and Strohn Lake was no longer dammed. The threat of sudden destructive icy floods in the Bear River Valley disappeared with the glacier&rsquo;s retreat.

Besides Beaumont, two other parks were made possible through his generosity.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The Beaumont Park area is rich in cultural significance (refer to History section            above).</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park&rsquo;s natural heritage, please don&rsquo;t           damage or remove them.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Wildlife is abundant within the park. The marsh area represents ideal habitat for many species of birds and aquatic insects. It is a community in which every member has a distinct role to play and is depended upon by all the others. Birds often seen in the early morning at the marsh include the Redwing Blackbird, Canada Geese, Loons, and Warblers. Beaumont is also home to beavers, and you can view their work along the trail.</li></ul>",

      "LocationNotes": "Bugaboo Provincial  Park is located in southeastern B.C., between Golden and Radium Hot Springs, and west of Highway 95. Access to the park is about 50km of gravel road from Hwy #95. This gravel road, which opens late spring through late fall, begins at Brisco, 27 kilometres north of Radium Hot Springs or 76 km south of Golden on Highway 95. A 4x4 is not required but a 2wd with some decent ground clearance is recommended. The last 3km section of the gravel road is rough; low-riding compact vehicles need to go slow to avoid scraping the bottom. It is recommended that visitors protect their vehicle perimeter with a portable chicken wire fence to deter porcupines and other small animals from chewing on rubber brake lines and tires. <br><br>Access to the northern portions of the park via the Vowell and Malloy Creek drainages is possible by leaving Highway 95 at Spillimacheen, north of Brisco, then crossing the Columbia River and turning left on the WestSide Road. After travelling 0.8 km, turn right onto Bobbie Burns Creekdrainage and drive past the lodge of the same name. Logging roads up VowellCreek and Malloy Creek lead to semi-open terrain which can be hiked intothe park. The status of bridges in inactive logging areas may vary inupper drainages. <br><br><h4>Winter Access </h4><p>Access roads are not maintained in winter. Snowmobiles are not permitted in the park and must be left at the summer parking lot.</p><p>Visitors wishing to visit the park in the winter months will either need to ski the long access road or use snowmobile, as far as the summer parking lot, or helicopter access. Independent parties (non-helicopter skiing clients) require a <a href=\"https://forms.gov.bc.ca/environment/bugaboo-helicopter-landing-lop/\">letter of permission</a> (LOP) to fly into the park by helicopter.

Butler, a British Army officer recognized for his    involvement in the Red River Rebellion. Working for the Canadian Government, he made a scouting trip west to the Rockies. The report he submitted back to the Government, contributed to the establishment of the Northwest Mounted Police in the area. He returned to the area again in 1873. His journey west took him by dogsled to what we now know as Fort St. John. He continued on to Hudson&rsquo;s Hope by horseback and from there paddled the Peace River by canoe. Since that time the area has received many names such as the Butler Range, Butler Mountain, and eventually to what we know it as today, Butler Ridge. The park was established in 2000. </li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> First Nations of the Treaty 8 Tribal Association have traditionally used he area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Butler Ridge Provincial Park is located in the Peace Foothill ecosection just east of the Rocky Mountains.    The area provides important winter range for caribou and stone sheep habitat in the higher elevations as well as moose and elk winter range in the lower elevations. A blue-listed species, the Arkansas rose, has been recorded in the park.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife (specific to this park or area):</strong> This area provides excellent fishing and wildlife viewing opportunities.

The lower Carmanah Valley was declared a provincial park in 1990, and the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys were added in 1995. The park offers protection to diverse forest ecosystems, including a large Sitka spruce ecosystem that represents 2% of BC&rsquo;s remaining old-growth forest.</p><p>Carmanah Walbran is home to some of the world&rsquo;s largest spruce trees, some reaching heights in excess of 95 metres and living for 800 years or more. The park is also home to ancient, gnarled cedars &ndash; estimated to be well over 1,000 years old &ndash; clinging to the side hills. Nestled beneath these awe-inspiring trees is a diverse variety of flora and fauna possible only in an ecosystem that has remained undisturbed for hundreds of years.</p><p>The recent addition of the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys completes the protection of the Carmanah Creek watershed and the southern portion of the Walbran Creek watershed. The park provides unique opportunities for forest research and education in the areas of biodiversity, wildlife and fisheries habitat. It is a majestic forest capable of inspiring all visitors who come here, and offers unforgettable recreational opportunities for hikers and wilderness lovers.</p><p>This coastal fringe of mainly Sitka spruce, with its associated plants and animals, is truly a special place to discover. Sitka spruce forests are typically coast-hugging &ndash; they are rarely found more than 80 kilometres inland and at elevations greater than 30 metres. The park&rsquo;s extensive groves of spruce attain a biomass (weight of plants per hectare) that is nearly twice that of a tropical forest. This dynamic system has developed over thousands of years and functions perfectly if left undisturbed.</p><p>Several hiking trails in the Carmanah Valley provide access to manyof the park&rsquo;s notable natural features, including some of the area&rsquo;s largest trees. Many sections of the trail are extremely muddy and difficult. Be equipped with appropriate clothing (including adequate rain gear) and good hiking boots.</p><p><strong>Date Established:</strong> March 13, 1991 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 16,365 hectares<br></p>",

During the 30s and 40s the local rod and gun club stocked the lakes and improved trails to allow access for recreational purposes.

Moose, deer and bears are occasionally observed. Birds are quite prevalent with nighthawks, woodpeckers, Canada jays, belted kingfishers, western tanagers and oregon junkos being the most common. Loons, mallards, widgeons and the great blue heron are more likely to be seen early in the season.

This unique and fragile landscape provides habitat for a diversity of rare flora and fauna. These grasslands can be viewed and accessed on existing cow trails and old  roads. However, the trails are unmarked and unmaintained. The Protected Area abuts the west bank of the Fraser River, just south of Gang Ranch.    </p>    <p>Churn Creek Protected Area was established in 1995 following recommendations in the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land Use Plan.

One of these men, Henry Cody, discovered the Cody Caves. Later, in 1899, the caves were the subject of a short story written by Roger Pocock for &ldquo;Argosy&rdquo; magazine entitled &ldquo;The Noble Five&rdquo;. This story described a cave whose inner chambers were walled with gold ore. The caves then grew in popularity and were visited by many locals and curious individuals including, in 1908, the governor General of Canada, Earl Grey. Though they are not walled with gold, the caves do contain an impressive display of calcite formations that can be seen in many areas of the approximately 800 metres of explorable passage. These formations are extremely old and have been growing at an average rate of about one cubic centimetre a century. The cave itself began formation when limestone beds laid down almost 600 million years ago were thrust upward by mountain building forces that occurred around 170 million years ago. Although the Cody Caves are almost unimaginably old and carved from solid rock, they are exceptionally fragile and can be irreparably damaged in seconds. In fact the caves have probably experienced more change in the 90 years since their discovery than in the previous 9,000.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Only guided cave tours for visitors&rsquo; safety and for protection of the cave&rsquo;s features.</li>      <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>     </ul>",

When it became evident that the gold was not available in the amounts estimated, the miners started moving north on the Fraser River. A few Chinese remained in the area. The area came into the hands of a man named Walker, who felt Emory Creek would become the head of riverboat navigation on the Fraser. Eventually, he sold the land to the Oppenheimer Brothers in early 1879. In the fall of 1879, Emory was chosen by the C.P.R. as the western terminus. In a short time it became Emory Creek. The town consisted of thirteen streets with its own newspaper, various shops, a brewery, nine saloons and a sawmill. When Yale was made the terminus, Emory was all but abandoned by 1885, with the completion of the railway.

Food cache pits, culturally altered trees, traditional trails, and lodge or &ldquo;kickwillie&rdquo; depressions have been documented within the park. A village site  near Tatuk Lake was the subject of an archaeological dig in the 1970s. In the early 1900s, the area  was sporadically populated by trappers, ranchers and fur-farmers. The Batnuni Wagon Trail ran through the southeast part of the park connecting to the  Meridian road. The Frontier Cattle Company drove their herds from the Home Ranch through this area, which Rich Hobson&rsquo;s books later documented. All natural and cultural resources are protected in the park. Damage to, collection or removal of any natural resource or cultural artifact is prohibited.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Finger-Tatuk Provincial Park protects one of the best representations of sub-boreal spruce and Englemann spruce/sub-alpine fir within the Nazko Upland. The area also contributes to the maintenance of local and provincial biological diversity. A wide range of lake sizes across a landscape interconnected by wetland riparian corridors provides important wildlife habitat features. The kokanee run each fall in Finger Creek is regionally significant.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Wild rainbow trout and kokanee are abundant in the area, and the diverse and high-value habitat in the park provide for a range of animal species including grizzly and black bear, ungulates, small fur-bearers, waterfowl, shore-birds, and eagles.</li>      </ul>",

Under the Plan, grazing and trapping are still permitted in the park. In 2013, 26 hectares were added as part of the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land-use Plan Goal 2 (special feature) process. </li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage</strong> - Little is known about the history of the park&rsquo;s land, and no specific archaeological sites have been identified. Since the area is rich in wildlife, it may have been, and may still be, used for sustenance hunting by First Nations.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation</strong> - Located in the Cariboo Plateau, a landscape heavily influenced by glaciation, the park features kettle lakes. These small shallow lakes formed when large buried ice pockets were left to melt after glacial ice receded. Uplands were smoothed by the glaciers, so the land is quite flat, true to the name of the park. Flat Lakes is rich in biodiversity because of the variety of ecosystems found within its borders. The lakes are  small, with complicated shorelines featuring rock outcrops, small islands, marshes and bogs. An abundance of aquatic vegetation carpets the shallows -  cattails, sedges, rushes, waterlilies and buckbean. The surrounding forest is composed of Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, spruce and aspen.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife</strong> - Wetlands connect most of the lakes, and these provide excellent food and shelter for waterfowl such as loons and herons, and mammals like moose, black bear, muskrat and beaver. Some species found in the park are rare or even facing threats of extinction, for example,  sandhill crane and American avocet.</li>    </ul>",

The kelp beds that are found in this area support nurseries for a wide array of sea life.</li>       <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Foch-Gilttoyees protects a regionally significant estuary complex at the north end of the Gilttoyees    Inlet. The Gilttoyees Creek and Peechugh Creek estuary is notable for its well-developed inter-tidal flats and relatively under-developed mud flats.

Imagine falling though the ice in the Northwest Territories, losing all the toes off one foot and the heel off the other to frostbite, thanking aboriginal knowledge that you did not lose more! Imagine not stopping there, traveling by boat and canoe down the Bulkley Valley to Vancouver and then paddling around Vancouver Island to find your future home. It took pioneer James French two adventurous years to travel from New Brunswick to Victoria. He pre-empted the land west of Sooke in 1885. French was an early naturalist, traveling the world to bring exotic animals to zoos for public enjoyment and education. After an expedition to Africa, French once brought home a small elephant, before selling it to the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. French died in 1952, survived by his family who continued to live on the property and play an active part in local logging. French had hoped that a much larger section of the west coast of Vancouver Island would be made into a provincial park. His home and favourite beach would become French Beach Provincial Park in 1974 - 20 years later, Juan de Fuca Provincial Park would further his dream.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> French Beach lies within the traditional territory of the T&rsquo;Sou-ke First Nation. Their economy was based on hunting, fishing and gathering, and extended families among the Straits people owned the lands and resources, which could not be sold, only inherited.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Beautiful hiking trails lead you through second growth forest of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, western hemlock and Western red cedar to the sand and pebble beach. You will also find salal, Oregon grape, evergreen huckleberries and a large variety of ferns along the trails.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Once on the beach, there are excellent whale-watching opportunities, particularly for Gray whales. These magnificent creatures migrate to northern feeding grounds in the spring and return south in the fall. Killer whales, otters, seals and sea lions can also be seen offshore. French Beach is also a great place to observe seabirds, Bald eagles and ospreys. A number of other animals can be found in the park, including frogs, salamanders and small mammals such as minks, squirrels and raccoons. Black bears and cougars make their homes in the surrounding areas and may move through the park, especially during warmer months.</li></ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> In 1860, while carrying out a survey of Howe Sound on board the Royal Navy survey ship H.M.S. Plumper, Captain George Henry was impressed by a towering mountain dominating the view to the northeast. Captain Richards chose to name the 2,678 metre mountain Mount Garibaldi, after the great 19th century Italian patriot and soldier, Giuseppe Garibaldi, a guerrilla general whose exploits and valour were held in high esteem. In 1907, a party of six Vancouver climbers reached the summit of Mount Garibaldi. The views from the peak inspired the establishment of summer climbing camps at Garibaldi Lake. This early interest led to the creation in 1920 of a park reserve. Garibaldi Provincial Park was legislated as a Class A park in 1927, a 195,000 hectare mountain wilderness just 64 kilometres north of Vancouver.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> During July and August the alpine areas of Garibaldi Provincial Park offer hikers an opportunity to view alpine flowers in bloom, a beautiful display of nature. Please keep to designated trails. Shortcutting trails destroys plant life and soil structure in fragile alpine meadows. Trail erosion by rain and melting snow occurs rapidly as a result. BC Parks asks for your cooperation as we help to repair damaged areas. Please help by obeying posted signs.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Small mammals and birds such as squirrels, chipmunks, grey jays, and flickers can often be seen. Large mammals such as mountain goats, deer, cougars, wolverines, grizzly and black bears, also call the park home, although are seen less frequently.</li></ul>",

There is no way to be certain how high a tsunami is going to be. The first wave to arrive at the coast is often not the largest, and each wave may be separated by up to an hour or more. Waves may continue for up to twelve hours, so you must stay on high ground until advised otherwise. Do not go to the beach to watch.</li>     </ul>",

The first reference to a Portage in the vicinity of what would later be known as the Giscome Portage is found in the journals of Simon Fraser (1806). The gold strikes on Germansen and Manson Creeks led to the Omineca Gold Rush in the late 1860s. In 1863 a guide from the Lheidli T&rsquo;enneh lead two Black miners across the trail, John Robert Giscome of Jamaica and Henry McDame from the Bahamas. These two men originally came to North America for the California Gold Rush, but arriving near the end of the rush they headed to the gold fields of the North. The trail now bears the name of Giscome as one of the first non-natives to travel across the portage. After being petitioned, the government constructed a wagon road over the Giscome Portage, and the navigation on the Crooked River was improved in 1871. Despite the numerous travellers using the Giscome Portage, no actual community developed there until the early years of the 20th century. This community was later to be known as the Huble Homestead. World War I initiated the decline of Giscome Portage and the decline accelerated with the construction of a road between Prince George and Summit Lake in 1919. Giscome Portage was bypassed as the transportation method shifted from water to road.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Park Visitors are able to view many species of native wildlife within a natural setting.

There&rsquo;s something new, different and exciting every month of the year at Goldstream Park.</p><p>Goldstream&rsquo;s numerous trails criss-cross through the dramatically different terrain of two distinct vegetation zones. The park is home to 600-year-old Douglas fir trees and western red cedar, mixed with western yew and hemlock, red alder, big leaf maple and black cottonwood. On the drier ridges visitors can find flowering dogwood, lodgepole pine and arbutus. The arbutus, with its thick leathery evergreen leaves, red-dish trunk and peeling bark, is Canada&rsquo;s only broad-leafed evergreen and is found exclusively on Vancouver Island and on the southwest coast of British Columbia. In the spring and early summer, Goldstream overflows with colourful wildflowers, including the shade-loving western trillium and the calypso, a delicate orchid of the mossy forest glades.</p><p>Trails range from easy, wheelchair-accessible walks to strenuous hikes and track along creeks, through forested uplands and past abandoned gold diggings from the days of the Gold Rush. More adventurous hikers can climb to the top of one of the highest points in Greater Victoria &ndash; Mount Finlayson, a recent addition to the park in 1994. Another trail leads you to stunning Niagara Falls, which cascades 47.5 metres down a rock cliff into a crystal clear canyon pool below.</p><p>The park is also the site of an annual chum salmon spawning run, which draws thousands of salmon &ndash; and visitors &ndash; every year. Riverside trails and observation platforms provide extraordinary opportunities to view this natural phenomenon, which also attracts Bald eagles, who swoop down to devour the bodies of the spawned out salmon.</p><p>Park naturalists are available at the Freeman King Visitor Center, which offers interpretive programs and informative lectures about the area&rsquo;s natural history for individuals and groups.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> Established in 1995, Gowlland Tod was dedicated under the Commonwealth Heritage Legacy Program, which was created to commemorate the spirit of the XV Commonwealth Games held in Victoria in 1994. Comprising more than 1,200 hectares, the park is a result of a unique partnership between the provincial and local governments, organizations and companies. The focus of this park is to preserve a heritage of green space on southern Vancouver Island for present and future generations.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The long history of settlement on Finlayson Arm is evident from the many archaeological village and midden sites found here. There is continuing importance of this area to First Nations for medicinal, ceremonial and spiritual values. An early copper mine, Vancouver Portland Cement Company (later developed as Butchart Gardens), the Caleb Pike homestead and an extensive network of old logging and mining roads are testament to the early pioneer settlement in the area.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Tod Inlet has long been valued for its natural beauty, ecological significance and recreational opportunities. The range of habitats and the waters of the inlet, the shoreline, Tod Creek and uplands support a diversity of wildlife. Blue herons, bald eagles, Peale&rsquo;s peregrine falcons, river otters, black-tailed deer and red squirrels frequent this area, as well as black bears and cougars. Dozens of plant species, some rare or threatened, are found in the mixed forest of arbutus, western red cedar, alder and coastal Douglas fir. Pockets of Garry oak forest, recognized as one of the most imperiled ecosystems in Canada, are located throughout the park. The rugged highlands of the Gowlland Range preserve rare, dry coastal Douglas fir habitat and feature grassy meadows, moss-covered rocky knolls and old-growth forest. More than 150 individual plant and animal species have been identified here including many birds and wildflowers. Nine identified species at risk, including the phantom orchid and Peale&rsquo;s peregrine falcon, can be found in the park. The Gowlland Range towers 430 metres over Finlayson Arm, a unique fjord that only replenishes its marine waters once a year. Species that are rare elsewhere in the world flourish in this isolated and stable habitat.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Blue herons, bald eagles, Peale&rsquo;s peregrine falcons as well as river otters, blacktail deer and red squirrels frequent this area.</li></ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> Hai Lake &ndash; Mount Herman Park was designated as a park on May 20, 2004 following recommendations from the Kalum Land and Resource Management Plan.<p>Mount Herman and Herman Lake were named after Peter Herman of Port Essington, who was born in Germany in 1862 and immigrated to Canada in 1882. He worked at the Port Essington cannery where he met and married Kate Spence (a native woman from Victoria, BC) and had four children (Willie, Walter, Rhoderic and Hilda). They later moved to Lakelse Lake near Terrace, where Peter logged and trapped. Peter became president of the Liberal Association of the north and a Liberal candidate for Skeena in 1903, but lost. Peter died in a drowning accident in 1907. His body was never found.</p></li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Hai Lake &ndash; Mount Herman Park lies within the traditional territory of the Kitselas First Nation. This park and the surrounding area are important to First Nations peoples for sustenance and cultural activities. In recent times the area has been a popular skating, fishing and camping location for Terrace residents and Boy Scouts.</li>       <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Herman Lake wetland is a Class 1 (&gt; 5 ha) riparian wetland that contains regionally significant salmon spawning and rearing habitat and Herman Creek is a salmonid spawning stream. The bog ecosystem around Herman Lake contains scattered and stunted Lodgepole Pine, Western Red Cedar, and Western Hemlock. In addition to water loving shrubs and herbs, the bogs contain specialized plants such as Sundew, White Bog Orchids and Bog Club Moss. Accumulations of moss and organic material are often greater than 100 cm and water tables are within 20 cm of the surface. The bog system is very susceptible to disturbance. Organic soils and dwarf shrubs can be severely damaged by vehicles and trampling. Re-growth after damage is slow. Regionally significant old growth Western Hemlock forest is located in the park (approximately 95 ha). This is one of the very few remaining old growth stands in the main Kitimat &ndash; Kitsumkalum valley.</li>    </ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> H&aacute;thayim was named Von Donop Inlet by Captain Daniel Pender of the Royal Navy, who conducted extensive hydrographic surveys in the area from 1860 until 1879. The name commemorates Victor Edward John Breton Von Donop, RN. Von Donop, a midshipman, arrived aboard HMS Charybis at Esquimalt in 1862. Charybis, a ship of 21 guns, had been dispatched to Canada from China at the time of the American Civil War when it seemed possible that hostilities might break out between Great Britain and the United States. Since it was first surveyed, this quiet inlet has contributed to the economy of British Columbia. Evidence of past logging and settlement is inconspicuous, as much of the area is being reclaimed by nature. </li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Lush forests of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar with scattered patches of Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, big-leaf maple and red alder that characterize the southern British Columbia coast are well represented around Von Donop Inlet. The old-growth forest between the inlet and Robertson/Wiley Lakes and the mature second-growth forest along the outlet of Robertson Lake are part of the area&rsquo;s mosaic. Undergrowth, in the form of red huckleberry, salal, Oregon grape and other shrubs and shade-tolerant ferns and flowering plants contributes to this forest&rsquo;s natural diversity. </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The park is home to Flying squirrels and Douglas squirrels, as well as river otter and mink. Harbour seals are often seen in the inlet, and during the winter months, Steller&rsquo;s and California sea  lions are present. Killer whales occasionally pass through Sutil Channel, but rarely enter the inlet. H&aacute;thayim contains excellent shellfish, including butter clams and littleneck clams. Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) may be present from May through August. Please check with the Department of Fisheries inCampbell River for recent information on harvesting and PSP regulations. Other forms of sea life present include jellyfish, sea sponges, cucumbers, octopus and turnicates. Nearby waters are noted for salmon and rockfish. Seabird populations increase during the winter months in the park. During spring and summer, visitors can hear the calls of varied thrush and Swainson&rsquo;s thrush, a variety of flycatchers as well as yellow-rumped townsend&rsquo;s and black-throated grey warblers. Bald eagles are often seen soaring above the inlet.</li>      </ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> In 1915, the pioneer settler known as Cougar Annie arrived on the west coast in Hesquiat Harbour and homesteaded on this wilderness property. She bore 8 of her 11 children here, outlasted 4 husbands and carved a magnificent, magical garden out of a thick and foreboding rainforest. The remoteness of the area brought inherent risks to Annie and her family; cougars prowled endlessly nearby, sensing easy prey. Ada Annie Rae-Arthur shot and trapped dozens of the animals and thus emerged the legend of Cougar Annie. This garden is now one of British Columbia&rsquo;s premier heritage gardens. Surrounded by the tall trees of the West Coast rainforest, Cougar Annie&rsquo;s garden is a place of strange and compelling beauty. From this remote location, Annie ran a nursery garden and shipped countless varieties of plants across Canada. For decades she advertised her wares (and occasionally for husbands) in the Western Producer and in the Winnipeg Free Press. The garden consists of a five-acre clearing, criss-crossed with more than two kilometres of meandering pathways and dotted with outbuildings that once housed goats and chickens. Resurrected from a tangle of salal, Scotch broom, and salmonberry, this garden has endured for nearly 100 years. The survival and the continuity of the garden make it an important heritage site. No other pioneer homestead in Clayoquot Sound remains in private hands and no other garden of this scope exists on the West Coast.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> There are many First Nations cultural heritage sites in Hesquiat Peninsula Park, including middens.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> This prominent low-elevation peninsula is a significant wilderness area protecting heritage sites,  representative old-growth forest stands of Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, white pine and yellow-cedar and a freshwater lake. The park also encompasses a variety of coastal ecosystems including extensive off-shore reefs, boulder, cobble and sand beaches, sea caves, sheltered bays, kelp beds and mudflats.</li></ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History</strong> - The first written records of caves in the area came after the turn of the century, in 1912, when a geologist noted the presence of caves at the north end of Horne Lake. A few years later, when the area was opened up for logging, the loggers knew the location of the caves. It is not known if the loggers ventured into the depths of the caves but a stream in one of the caves was dammed to provide water for the steam donkeys used in early logging practices.<br><br>It was not until 1939 that the caves gained public attention. Two cave explorers were responsible for rediscovering what they named the &ldquo;Horne Lake Wonder Caves&rdquo;. At this point only the Main and Lower Main Caves were known, although some speculated on the potential for more caves in the area. The presence of a noticeable air current at the mouth of Main Cave led people to believe there must be a system of caves, of which Main was just a part. In 1941, a storekeeper from Qualicum reported entering a sizable cave almost a quarter of a mile long, some distance from the already discovered caves. This was probably the    first discovery of Riverbend Cave.<br><br>By 1945, the caves had become a known tourist stop for people looking for adventure. This increased use of the caves, however, took its toll and by    the summer of 1945 a party of explorers noted that many of the once beautiful formations were either broken or removed by souvenir seekers. This same party found the storekeeper&rsquo;s cave, Riverbend.<br><br>In 1957, the Horne Lake Caves area of approximately 29 hectares was established as a recreation reserve in an effort to ensure opportunities for the public to continue to view these caves in the future. Six years later a group of cavers from Victoria discovered the two entrances to Eggshell Cave. The value of this area was recognized by members of the Canadian Speleological Society, who then approached the provincial government to have this area protected. Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park was established in February 1971.</li><li><strong>Conservation</strong> - In addition to protecting the karst features and caves, this park includes a forested addition that protects approximately 1 km of the Qualicum River adjacent to Horne Lake Caves. This forest provides a visual buffer for visitors to the existing park. The area also protects high fish and wildlife values.</li></ul>",

If you are on the beach and feel strong shaking from an earthquake or if the water suddenly recedes, move immediately to higher ground (greater than 15 metres or 45 feet above the tide line). There is no way to be certain how high a tsunami is going to be. The first wave to arrive at the coast is often not the largest, and each wave may be separated by up to an hour or more. Waves may continue for up to twelve hours, so you must stay on high ground until advised otherwise.

From 1870 to 1910, a succession of sawmills came into operation and with them, the community grew. Thomas Kilby came to Harrison Mills in 1902 and by 1904, had built a three-story building consisting of a general store and hotel. His son, Acton and wife, Jessie ran this operation until their retirement in 1976. The Provincial Government acquired this area. Today, the general store is a museum and is operated by the Ministry responsible for Tourism. The beach area has been developed into a riverside park with 22 campsites, a small day-use area, and a boat launch under the jurisdiction of BC Parks.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The Harrison and Fraser Rivers served as major transportation routes for the local First Nations population. In the mid to late 1800s, the Fraser River and Cariboo gold rushes created considerable activity along the Harrison River, near the site of this historic park.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park lies within the Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone and is representative of the Fraser floodplain landscape. Upland vegetation includes cottonwood, poplar, alder, and willow while the understory consists largely of red currant and salmonberry.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Kilby Provincial Park is a designated British Columbia Wildlife Watch area. It is an excellent location to view large concentrations of wintering Bald Eagles as well as graceful trumpeter swans that migrate to the area from Alaska. Other common bird species to the park area include ravens, geese, eagles, swans, finches, chickadees and jays.

This zone occurs at low to mid-elevations. In general, it is one of the wettest areas in BC and typically has cool summers and mild winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 100-440 cm. The park is situated on an active floodplain of the Kitimat River. Vegetation differences throughout the park depend on differences in bench height and frequency of flooding. The soils in active floodplains are usually poorly developed. <br>       <br>       High bench sites have seasonally fluctuating water tables, but only flood every few years. Forests are typically dominated by Sitka Spruce, however Red Cedar, Western Hemlock and Amabilis Fir are also present. The shrub layer is dominated by Devil&rsquo;s Club. Small amounts of Salmonberry, Alaskan and Oval-leaf Blueberry and young conifers are also present in the understory. Spiny Wood Fern, Oak Fern, Foamflowers, Twisted Stock, and leafy mosses are also common in this plant community. <br>       <br>       Middle bench plant communities have high and prolonged water tables that limit conifer establishment. The most common species in this area are Black Cottonwood, Red-Osier Dogwood, Red Alder, and Salmonberry. <br>       <br>       The low bench plant communities are found adjacent to the river and back channels and are subjected to prolonged annual flooding, sediment erosion and deposition. The occasional Black Cottonwood is found in this area, but the most common species are willows along with Red and Sitka Alder. </li>      </ul>",

From plans drawn by English architects, Busk built a large mansionthat once sat on a rise a short way up Kokanee Glacier Road. As a countrysquire and gracious gentlemen, Mr. Busk enjoyed entertaining guests butalso had many interests in surveying, mining, fruit ranching and Scouting.He lived an eloquent, lavish life style. After 1913 the romance of hisnew way of life had dulled and it is estimated he went through threefortunes. Sadly, within a few years he died, disillusioned by most ofhis ventures, withdrawn and ignored by friends whom he once had entertainedso lavishly. The park as it is seen today was originally establishedin 1955.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Archaeological evidence in the park indicates seasonal campsites used by First Nations people. Remains of European settlement include evidence of old homesteads and an early estate. Nearby are mining ghost towns and village museums displaying the Kootenay area history.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> With 257 hectares, Kokanee CreekPark has extensive sandy beaches and a large delta area. Backed by a gentlerising upland, this area gives way to the forested slopes of the Slocan Rangeof the Selkirk Mountains. Kokanee Creek bisects the landscape to form a steepcanyon.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>    <li><strong>History:</strong> Established in 1922, this is one of the oldest parks in the province. Geologically, this area is composed of an immense system of granite rock known as the Nelson batholith. During the earth&rsquo;s cooling process, slower-cooling mineralized solutions was subjected to great pressure that caused them to be pushed into holes and cracks in this granite mass. These became the deposits and finger-like veins, rich in gold and silver ore that caused the local mining boom at the end of the 19th century. Several mines paid quite well but most were worked for only a few years. Many of the park&rsquo;s trails were originally built for miners hauling ore and supplies. Today we can only marvel at the tenacity of those prospectors, who clung to steep rock faces throughout the park while trying to scratch a living from their mining claims.</li>       <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park&rsquo;s primary roles are to:        <ul>   <li>Represent sub-alpine, alpine landscapes and associated ecological resources of the Selkirk Mountain ranges.</li>        <li>Conserve grizzly bear and mountain goat habitat.</li>        <li>Maintain the characteristics and qualities of the natural environment and associated features, and</li>        <li>Conserve cultural heritage of the early alpine mining history of the West Kootenays.</li>       </ul></li>      <li><strong>Vegetation:</strong> Vegetation is typical of this elevation, with exposed bedrock and gravel moraine near the peaks where only lichens and a few other hardy plants survive. Stunted Engelmann spruce and white-bark pine are common at the timberline, with beautiful sub-alpine flower meadows in the wetter areas. The numerous steep slopes and avalanche paths support slide alder and huckleberry. The lower, more protected slopes are forested with Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, hemlock and western red cedar. The few pure stands of subalpine larch are particularly stunning in October when their needles turn golden-yellow in the fading sun.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Bird species such as the blue grouse and Franklin grouse inhabit the forests, and ptarmigan are often seen in the open areas. Golden eagles are occasionally seen soaring majestically overhead. Small animals such as the hoary marmot, pika, ground squirrels, and marten are    common, while larger species such as the mountain goat, mule deer and black bear are present in lesser numbers. The park contains most of the range for several grizzly bears, and further protection of significant grizzly bear habitat was the main reason for the expansion of the park in 1995. Separation of people and grizzlies is an important management objective - for the protection of both parties. To protect these endangered bears, areas such as the Coffee Creek drainage have no development and use is discouraged. Other trails are carefully designed to avoid bear habitat or closed at certain times of the year when bears are known to be feeding on ripe berries nearby.       <ul>        <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>        </ul>      </li>      </ul>",

It rises north and westward from the hot, dry Thompson valleys through three grassland communities to the forested hills above. Nowhere else in western North America will you find these grassland communities in such close proximity to each other.</p>     <p><strong>Special Feature: </strong>This protected area fulfils a very important conservation role in representing the Thompson Basin and Northern Thompson Uplands Ecosections. This protected area contains complex geology, a mixture of grasslands and forest types, a highly differential set of topographical features and soils and a variety of cultural uses combining to produce an area of notable diversity.</p>     <p>      Spring comes early to the lower hot, dry slopes with plants responding to the short, moist season. In contrast, the upper grasslands and forests are not in full bloom until early June when brilliant balsamroot followed by brown-eyed susan wash the hillsides. Beyond the grasslands, ancient ponderosa pines in a sea of bluebunch wheatgrass give way to groves of trembling aspen and stands of Douglas fir, some of which are believed to be over 400 years old. California bighorn sheep, mule deer, black bear and waterfowl are common residents and visitors to the protected area, while the Northern Pacific rattlesnake, sharp-tailed grouse and flammulated owl live more secretive lives within its boundaries.</p>     <p>      Lac du Bois Grasslands Protected Area is your protected area.

From the intersection of Fortune Drive and Tranquille Road, take 8th Street north through two sets of traffic lights. At the overpass, move into the left-hand lane and turn straight ahead up the hill between the subdivisions. At the cattle guard the surface changes to gravel and is a good, but narrow, well-traveled road. Expect to meet logging trucks and school buses. </li>       <li>B: In the west, <strong>Tranquille-Criss Creek Forest Service Road</strong> (also known as Red Lake Road) rises steeply to the Dewdrop Range and the deep canyon of Tranquille Valley. From the intersection of Fortune Drive and Tranquille Road, follow Tranquille Road past the airport towards Tranquille. Turn right over the railway tracks and around the fields before crossing the Tranquille River and going up the long, gradual hill. At the sharp blind 180 degree turn, there are two choices: go straight ahead to Dewdrop Flats and the red lava cliffs of Dewdrop Range; or go around the corner and up the hill to follow the spectacular Tranquille canyon. Expect to meet logging trucks and other local traffic.</li>     </ul>    Two other roads give vehicle access to the protected area, each leading into a different type of scenery:     <ul>   <li><strong>Long Lake Road</strong>: From the ATV area on the Lac du Bois Road, Long Lake Road winds its way through the grasslands to the forests past rolling hills and small ponds. It is a narrow, dirt track, steep in places; closed during winter and spring break-up or during adverse conditions that would affect the stability of the road.</li>       <li><strong>Dairy Creek Road</strong>: To get to the north edge of the protected area, take this logging road that runs through Douglas fir forest and beside deeply entrenched streams. It can be reached by following Westsyde Road. It is a narrow, gravel road steep in places; an alternative route when weather conditions permit. It connects to the north end of the Long Lake Road and eventually connects to the Lac du Bois Road. There are many junctions along the way so a good map is essential.</li>     </ul>     The road lying to the west of Wheeler Mountain is deeply rutted and partly washed out in places. It is not recommended for public use.<br>   <br>Vehicle access is limited to only those roads shown on the map; all other trails are closed to motorized vehicles.

Sheep in large flocks were over-wintered in the 1940&rsquo;s before being taken to summer pastures west of the Fraser River. All these activities took their toll on the fragile grassland communities.<br>        A fenced pasture rotation system was put in place in 1977 that controls how cattle use the grasslands.

There are many stories to explain how the lake was named; according to one, it gained its name when a trapper lost his only hatchet axe when chopping a hole in the frozen lake. This area is rich in tales of fur traders, gold seekers and cattle ranchers. By the 1860&rsquo;s, gold fever was running high, as miners searched for the motherlode first near Likely, and later at Barkerville. With teams of horses, mules and oxen, the fortune-seekers plodded north along the Cariboo Wagon Road skirting the eastern shores of the lake.    </p>    <p>     Nowadays, Lac La Hache Park is a stopping point for weary travellers. Set amongst a stately Douglas-fir forest, the cool, green conifers shade campers from the hot Cariboo sun. Lac La Hache Park is located on Highway 97, 13 km north of the community of Lac La Hache. Established in 1956, with 83 campsites, flush toilets, tap water, a sani-station and a self-guided nature trail, Lac La Hache Park is a very pleasant campground. The day-use area is located across Highway 97 on the shore of Lac La Hache and has an adventure playground, picnic tables, picnic shelter, boat launch, developed beach, changehouse and flush toilets.    </p>    <p>     This is an excellent fishing lake for Kokanee and lake trout, as well as rainbow trout and burbot during the summer months. However, fishing need not be your only recreational pursuit, as the lake is also a popular place for power boating and water-skiing.    </p>    <p>     The Heritage House at 108 Mile is a half-hour&rsquo;s drive from the campground, and is open from May to September. The campground host or <a href=\"#contact\">Park Operator</a> can inform you of other things to do in the area, as well as boat rental locations.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> The historic Cariboo Wagon road runs through the park. This was originally just a trail used by fur    traders from 1803 to 1810. During the Cariboo Gold Rush of the 1860&rsquo;s it was rebuilt, and it linked the gold fields of the Cariboo to the gold markets of the world, via the shipyards of Vancouver. One of the stops on the park&rsquo;s Interpretive Trail is on the actual Wagon Road. The overgrown track seems a far cry from our modern Highway 97.<br>One of the stopping points on the Wagon Road for weary miners was the Blue Tent Ranch. It was built by the Wright family in 1862, after they    discovered that cattle and the roadhouse provided a much steadier income than gold mining. The present day park is located on part of the original    ranch land. Throughout the park, you can see the stumps from the lumber used to build the original ranch house. This heritage house still stands    today, and can be seen next to the highway, roughly three kilometres north of the park.Lac La Hache was established as a Class A Provincial Park in 1956.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Both the Shuswap and Chilcotin First Nations used the area. Long before the lure of wealth brought the fur traders west, the Shuswap Indians established pit houses near the present day village of Lac La Hache. The Chilcotins named the lake Kumatakwa, meaning Chief or Queen of the waters.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park is in the Interior Douglas Fir Zone, which is found in BC&rsquo;s dry interior. There is a superb old-growth stand of Douglas-fir trees surrounding the campground. A fire in the 1960&rsquo;s burned several hectares, and you can still see the scars on the bases of some fir trees, their thick bark allowed these trees to survive. Fire is part of natural succession here &ndash; sunlight reaching the forest floor allows the growth of trembling aspen and lodgepole pine, as well as pinegrass, bunchberry and beautiful pink wild roses. </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Birds that thrive in this lakeside habitat include bald eagle, osprey and red-tailed hawk, as well as forest birds such as pileated woodpeckers, saw-whet owls, red crossbills, chickadees and nuthatches.<br>       Because of the diversity in plant species, a wide variety of mammals lives in this area, from moose and black bears to humble shrews and chipmunks.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> Lakelse Lake Wetlands Provincial Park was designated as a park on May 20, 2004, following recommendations from the Kalum Land and Resource Management Plan.</li>       <li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> Lakelse Lake Wetlands Park protects a biologically exceptional and Provincially significant warm-water wetland complex. Warm water springs in the Lakelse Lake Wetlands drain into Lakelse Lake, the largest warm water lake in northwestern BC. Clearwater and Andalas Creeks have open water throughout the winter. The streams are fed by warm water springs along an escarpment above the creeks.       </p>      <p>       The bog ecosystem in the Lakelse Lake Wetlands is regionally significant. It contains scattered and stunted Lodgepole Pine, Western Redcedar, and Western Hemlock. In addition to water loving shrubs and herbs, the bogs contain specialized plants such as sundews, tall white bog orchids and bog club-moss. Accumulations of moss and organic material are often greater than 100cm and water tables are within 20cm of the surface.</p>      <p>       The south end of Lakelse Lake contains the most extensive cover of emergent and submerged aquatic plants remaining in Lakelse Lake.       Dominant plants include Swamp horsetail in water to 1m and reeds in water to 4m in depth. The band of vegetation extends from Schulbuckhand Creek, on the east side of the park, to the outlet of the Lakelse River in the west. The aquatic vegetation has established on shallows built up by sediments from inflowing streams (Schulbuckhand, Clearwater, Andalas, and Ena Creeks). The aquatic vegetation is stabilized by the constant replenishment of sediments and nutrients that are carried in the streams.       </p>      <p>       The park also contains regionally significant valley bottom old growth stands. Valley bottom old growth in the Kitimat Valley is relatively rare and a special feature. Several small stands are located in the northwest corner, between Andalas and Clearwater Creek and on the southeast boundary of the park. Mature and old-growth forests commonly found on higher ground in the Lakelse Lake &ndash; Lakelse River area are very productive and contain Western hemlock, Sitka Spruce (largest trees in stand), and Western redcedar. Shrub cover is dense and is dominated by Devil&rsquo;s Club, Salmonberry, and Oval-leaf huckleberry. Herbs are well developed, but the moss layer is thin.       </p>      </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Lakelse Lake Wetlands Park contains internationally significant salmon spawning and rearing habitat and critical habitat for over-wintering steelhead. The large reed beds around the southern shoreline of Lakelse Lake and the streams that run through the alluvial fans and wetlands provide prime fish habitat. Steelhead over-winter in the reed beds. The warm water of Clearwater Creek support a late fall Coho run. Lakelse Lake and its tributaries are important to sockeye salmon. Sockeye salmon rear for a year within the lake prior to migrating to the sea the following April. Typically, 500,000 plus sockeye fry rear in the lake with 5-10,000 sockeye returning to the lake every fall. Although, in recent years as few as 1,000 adult spawners have returned. Consequently, Lakelse sockeye salmon are subject to a recovery strategy. The quality of water that drains through the wetlands is critical to the Lakelse River fishery. The water drains into the lake through the wetlands and out the Lakelse River, which drains from the southwest corner of the lake, approximately 0.5 km from the northern boundary of the park. <br>       <br>       The wetlands also contain regionally significant waterfowl habitat that is of great importance to migratory and over-wintering waterfowl. Trumpeter Swan (a provincially blue-listed/threatened species) over-winter and nest in the wetlands. There are reports of more than 100 swans wintering in the wetlands. Swans stay in the area from early winter to spring and breeding occurs in the wetlands. Geese and ducks feed and rest in the wetlands and in the reed beds at the south end of the lake. <br>       <br>       Grizzly and Black Bears use the corridor from Clearwater Lakes along Clearwater Creek to the wetlands. Grizzlies use the east side of the park in the spring (to feed on shrubs) and fall (to feed on salmon). One of the regions highest seasonal (fall) concentrations of Grizzlies is found along Clearwater Creek. Grizzly Bear density varies with the size of the salmon run. Historically there was a large seasonal population of Grizzly Bears in the wetland. Grizzlies were known to stay in the area until December, feeding on the late Coho runs in Coldwater Creek. Occasionally, after the late feeding, Grizzlies denned in the wetlands because snow accumulations prevented them from getting to their usual denning areas. The Cecil Creek drainage, west of the park, is a crossing zone for Grizzlies from four different populations. The Grizzly Bears breed in this area and cubs are often reared in the wetland. <br>       <br>       The wetlands are also an important seasonal habitat for Black Bear, Wolf, Beaver and other small furbearers. Some of the Black Bears in the area are subspecies Ursus americanus kermodei, (white phase). Black Bear use of the area is very high. The bears forage on Pacific Crab-apple and salmon.       <ul>        <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>        </ul>      </li>     </ul>",

This colourful description of the stately trees is reputed to have originated from the Governor General Viscount Willingdon in April 1928. Cathedral Grove was a well-known tourist stop on the Alberni Road in the 1920s and 1930s when the timber was owned by the Victoria Lumbering and Manufacturing Company. For 15 years the public encouraged the provincial government to acquire the lands within Block 35, Cameron Lake area. The citizens&rsquo; organizations, The Associated Boards of Trade of Vancouver Island, petitioned the government in 1929 to preserve forever, for the public benefit, the well-known stand of timber at Cameron Lake, known as Cathedral Grove. In 1944 H.R. MacMillan, a well-known forester donated the 136 hectares of land for the perpetual enjoyment of the public in recognition of the unique stand of trees. Three years later, the area was established as a Class A provincial park.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park protects and preserves an internationally significant representative example of Douglas fir old-growth forest within the East Vancouver Island and the Coastal Douglas fir Biogeoclimatic Zone.</li>    <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Many species of wildlife use the old-growth forest as their home including several types of woodpeckers, owls, insects, reptiles, amphibians, deer, elk, black bear and cougar. The Cameron River, which flows through the park, contains rainbow, brown and cutthroat trout.<ul><li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li></ul></li></ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History</strong> - Marble Range Park was established in 1995. Under the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land-use Plan, uses that were permitted before 1995 will continue in the park: livestock grazing, hunting, trapping and guiding. In 2013, 2,215 hectares were added to the park as part of the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land-use Plan (special feature) process.</li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage</strong> - Marble Range Park is within the traditional territory of the Shuswap People. Three First Nations continue to use the park for sustenance, spiritual and cultural purposes. If you find any First Nations heritage sites, do not disturb them or remove anything - they are protected under the<em> Heritage Conservation Act.</em> </li>       <li><strong>Conservation</strong> - The principal reasons for the protection of the Marble Range area were for: the preservation of alpine and subalpine habitats in the Pavillion Ranges Ecosection (PAR), the preservation of endangered and non-endangered wildlife and their habitat (e.g., bighorn sheep, mule deer and cougar) and for high back-country recreation values. The park is located within the Pavilion Ranges, and protects mostly mid- to high elevation ecosystems. The forests contain old growth Douglas-fir, spruce, lodgepole and whitebark pine, ranging into subalpine parklands and extensive alpine tundra. The karst topography is unusual in BC, and is protected in only a few other parks, mostly on Vancouver Island. Soils in the area are high in calcium, so they support a number of rare    plants.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife</strong> - Wildlife viewing is popular in the Marble Range. Please remember your binoculars and telephoto lenses, as keeping your distance will minimize disturbance to the California bighorn sheep and other animals. The park, along with the nearby <a href=\"../edge_hills/\">Edge Hills Park</a> provides important habitat for species that require large, diverse ecosystems, such as cougar and black bear. The Marble Range is excellent as mule deer summer range. Every year, California bighorn sheep migrate between alpine areas in the Marble Range and steep cliffs of the Fraser River canyon in Edge Hills Provincial Park. The migration is dictated by food availability. Sheep will winter in the warmth of the canyon, where tender green shoots begin to grow early in the season. Here, the sheep also encounter less snow, and have access to steep and rugged terrain for protection from predators. In early summer, the sheep migrate to alpine areas in the Marble Range. Over the past 40 to 50 years, many of these routes have been abandoned, with only a few routes remaining. A three year study has been initiated by the Clinton and District Outdoor Sportsmen Association in order to determine exactly where the migration routes are. The results will assist in future management decisions.</li>      <li><a href=\"../../wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>     </ul>",

The park now supports a second-growth forest of mostly pine and larch. It was established in 1982 as a holiday destination to offer recreational opportunities for the local community and tourists along the travel corridor. The east side of the park contains McDonald Creek, its namesake. It is located in the Ktunaxa/Kinbasket, Okanagan and Shuswap first nation traditional territories.   </li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> McDonald Creek Provincial Park encompasses 468 ha. The Arrow reservoir bisects the park and creates two distinct portions of protected area. The East Side protects lakeshore riparian habitat and kokanee spawning habitat associated with an alluvial fan and creek, a somewhat rare feature for interior lakes. The west side with its forested upland habitat provides critical winter range for ungulates, primarily deer and elk. Conifers of pine and larch are the primary trees found in the park. Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park&rsquo;s natural heritage, please do not damage or remove them. Mushroom harvesting is not allowed.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> This park supports a diverse population of small mammals such as squirrels, chipmunks and porcupines. In late August and mid September the spawning kokanee are a point of interest to park visitors. With its critical winter habitat, elk and deer are commonly observed during the off season.<br>       Park users should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment.

Lower elevations are noted for stands of coastal western hemlock and interior Douglas fir. Englemann Spruce, subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine can be found at higher elevations, and above those, alpine tundra. Many of the stands in the subalpine environment are old growth forests. The portion of the creek below the falls protects Chinook, bull trout and rainbow trout spawning and rearing habitat. Portions of the park are an important breeding and nesting habitat for harlequin duck.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> In combination with the Nahatlatch and Stein protected areas, Mehatl Creek    Provincial Park offers habitat for species that are dependent on old-growth ecosystems and a high degree of wilderness.

All sedentary marine life, including abalones,  scallops and sea cucumbers, are fully protected within the park&rsquo;s boundaries, which extend 300 metres out from the shore. This nature reserve is an important nesting colony for thousands of Glaucous-winged Gulls, as well as Pelagic Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemots, Black Oystercatchers and many other species of birds. Marine life around the island includes river otters and harbour seals throughout the year, and Steller&rsquo;s and California sea lions from late fall through to summer.<br><br>Mitlenatch, which means &ldquo;calm waters all around&rdquo; in the Coast Salish language, is a small rocky island that features semi-arid conditions caused by the island&rsquo;s location in the &ldquo;rain shadow&rdquo; of Vancouver Island. The park receives less than 75 cm (30 inches) of rain each year &ndash; about half the Campbell River average. Rain-bearing clouds pass eastward from the Pacific Ocean and drop much of their moisture on Vancouver Island. As they descend across the Strait of Georgia, they warm and pick up new moisture, which will be dropped on the Coast Mountains of mainland British Columbia.<br><br>Accessible by boat only, Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park offers excellent opportunities to observe and photograph wildflowers and birds. Visit in May when the island&rsquo;s meadows of spring wildflowers are in bloom, or in late May to July when the harvest brodia blooms and in the last half of June when the coastal cactus bloom. Birders should approach the observation blind as a group, slowly and quietly, this may help to reduce the birds&rsquo; anxiety and allow you to observe their behaviour and &ldquo;family life&rdquo; more easily.<br><br>The island is a very sensitive ecosystem that is extremely prone to damage by visitors who venture off the designated trails.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> Monkman Provincial Park was named after Alex Monkman, an individual who expended a considerable amount of effort attempting to build a transportation route from the Peace River farming country down to the Pacific ports. In 1922, he and a group of fur trappers discovered what is now known as Monkman Pass. It was this pass that provided him with his vision for a railroad, a direct and economical route south. Failing to get government support for his venture, Monkman focused on the alternative--building a highway. The Monkman Pass Highway Association was formed in 1936, and over the next three years, many determined volunteers laboured to blaze this new trail. Limited funding, harsh conditions, and the outbreak of the Second World War eventually brought the project to a halt. A railway was later built to the northwest over the Pine Pass, and Monkman&rsquo;s &ldquo;highway&rdquo; slowly faded into historical obscurity. Today, only a few sections are visible along the <a href=\"camphike.html#trail\">Monkman Lake Trail</a>, a route that follows parts of the original road. The Brooks Falls in Monkman Provincial Park, was named after Carl Brooks, one of the volunteers who worked along with Alex Monkman and the Highway Association. A cairn marking overlooking the falls has been placed in his honour.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Lower elevations in the park are dominated by mature sub-alpine fir, white spruce and lodgepole pine. The higher elevations support growths of Englemann spruce, sub-alpine fir and white spruce. Above the treeline, only plants adapted to the conditions are to be found. Monkman Provincial Park conserves representative areas of the Central Rocky Mountains and Foothills. Lower elevations in the park are dominated by mature sub-alpine fir, white spruce and lodgepole pine. The higher elevations support growth of Engelmann spruce, sub-alpine fir and white spruce. Above treeline, the trees become dwarfed and twisted. Alpine meadows of heathers, grasses and wildflowers, such as white rhododendron, arctic lupine, glacier lily and Indian paintbrush cover large areas and are intermixed with shrubs.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The diverse range of habitat in Monkman Provincial Park supports grizzly and black bear, mountain goats, caribou  and moose. During the warmer seasons, deer, mountain sheep, gray wolves, fishers, martens, wolverines, marmots, hares, and red squirrels are joined by  numerous bird species that include owls, ptarmigan, grouse, geese and loons. Because of the fierce winter climate, most of the larger animals tend to seek a more hospitable range during the winter months.<br><br><a href=\"camphike.html#kinuseo\">Kinuseo Falls</a> presents an impassable obstacle to migrating fish, so fish habitat is not the same above and below the falls. Larger fish are able to follow the Murray River drainage from lower elevations to the falls. Above the falls, only small char, trout, grayling and whitefish inhabit the Murray River and upper Monkman Creek.</li></ul>",

The park protects a chain of 12  small lakes, popular as a day or overnight canoeing destination. It is an idyllic place to visit, rewarding paddlers with clear, shallow lakes and abundant aquatic plants and flowers. The many tiny reed-fringed islands and surrounding marshes provide excellent habitat for deer, moose, waterfowl and amphibians.<br>     <br>Stuart Maitland, a local guide outfitter, first cleared and named portages linking the main lakes in the <a href=\"canoe.html\">Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a> in the early 1970s, with assistance from Hugh Kirkland and Kevin Marks. These three ambitious young men were in their late teens at the time, and independently sought government assistance to do the work. Today, the three main lakes in the chain are named after the youth who first developed the route. The route was later upgraded in 1987/88 by youth members of the Provincial Job Trac program.<br>     <br>The park is a wonderful place to spend leisure time canoeing, bird-watching, and wildlife viewing. Canoeing along the <a href=\"canoe.html\">Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a> is the primary recreational activity, and both day and overnight trips are popular. Camping areas are available at either end of the canoe route, but the only developed sites are located at the main access point at Marks Lake and at the north end of Maitland Lake. While the 1100 Road into Moose Valley isn&rsquo;t maintained in winter, the area is still a haven for cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing. A local outfitter offers one to two-day dog sled tours in the winter and guided canoe trips in the park.<br>     <br><strong>Special Features</strong>: Wetlands and sphagnum bogs can be accessed and viewed via canoe.<br>     <br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 2,500 hectares",

These numerous wetlands and small lakes provide habitat for a variety of wildlife species, and are also very rich in delicate sphagnum mosses, which are an important part of the ecosystem. It has been shown that water is purified as it travels through this vegetation.<br>       <br>       The floating peat bogs are very sensitive to degradation by canoeists during low water levels. Because of this, portions of the chain may be    restricted during such times. Please do not attempt to push your canoe through at low water.<br>       The landscape in and surrounding the park provides a snapshot of the area&rsquo;s glacial history. This extensive wetland complex was the result of    the last ice age. Lakes and small ponds were left behind following the melting of large chunks of buried glacial ice. Now they are annually    replenished by snow-melt and underground springs. The forested rocky outcrops surrounding the park are also a product of the last ice age.</li>     <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The numerous wetlands and small lakes provide habitat for muskrat and beaver, waterfowl, and of course moose.

The lake was named after the Rev. Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice, author of &ldquo;The History of the Northern Interior of British Columbia,&rdquo; which describes his 20 years of explorations and missionary work in this area of the province.<br><br>The traditional Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en name is Wet-zuhn-buhn (pronounced wet-zin-bun), meaning the &ldquo;blueish-green colour of the water.&rdquo; Morice River is called Wet-zuhn-kwa. In the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en language &ldquo;Kwa&rdquo; refers to a river or stream, and &ldquo;buhn&rdquo; refers to a body of water like a lake.<br><br>The park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.</li>      <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Morice Lake Provincial Park is located within the traditional territory of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en First Nation. Known as the people of the lower drainage, the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en have been living in this part of the continent since time immemorial. The park lies in the Lhudis Bin and C&rsquo;iniggit Nenik&euml;kh house territories within the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en territory. The Lhudis Bin house territory is in the house of Cas yex (Grizzly House) that belongs to the Gitdumden (Bear/Wolf) clan. The C&rsquo;iniggit Nenik&euml;kh house territory is in the house of Yextsowiten (Thin House) that belongs to the Gilseyhyu (Big Frog) clan.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The conservation role of Morice Lake Park is to protect:<ul> <li>Water quality, fish habitat and fish populations at the headwaters of an important salmon and steelhead river.</li>     <li>Wildlife (Grizzly bears, mountain goats, moose, deer, caribou).</li>     <li>Habitat for wildlife within the park and the adjacent land-base of the Morice River watershed.</li>     <li>Old growth forests.</li>     <li>Rare whitebark pine ecosystems.</li>    </ul>The lake provides important rearing habitat for the Nanika River sockeye stock and has resident populations of rainbow and lake trout, Dolly Varden, burbot and kokanee. The upper reaches of the Morice River provides important spawning habitat for Chinook salmon.<br><br>Forests in the park reflect a transition from interior types in the east, to coastal types in the west. The park also contains good quality Grizzly Bear habitat, riparian and wetland ecosystems, rare whitebark pine ecosystems, and blue-listed Bull Trout. The high fisheries values in Morice Lake Park are integral to the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en people, indicated by the many archaeological sites occurring along the lake.<br><br>Morice Lake Provincial Park also provides important ecosystem services (the benefits that people receive from ecosystems) that include clean water, natural flood control, carbon storage, air purification, nutrient cycling, food, biodiversity, recreation, aesthetic experience and spiritual experience. Morice Lake plays an important role in regulating water quantity, water temperature, and release of spring melt waters, which is important for both fish habitat and downstream water users.</li>    <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> This is a wilderness Park and many species of wildlife are prevalent and widespread. Larger species include: grizzly bears, black bears, mountain goats, moose, deer, and caribou.

At an elevation of 2,787 metres, Mount Edziza is an outstanding feature of this rugged and arresting domain.</p>     <p>Mount Edziza, whose peak reaches 2,787 metres, is a composite volcano consisting of thin basalt flows and a central dome of andesite, dacite and rhyolite with a glaciated crater nearly 2,500 metres in diameter.

Successive lava flows raised the dome above the encircling plateau and spread lava over an area 65 kilometres by 25 kilometres. The last basalt flow occurred only 10,000 years ago, at which time it solidified in place and plugged the central vent.</p>     <p>In the years since Mount Edziza became dormant, numerous small eruptions have taken place around it, creating more than 30 cinder cones. Perfectly symmetrical Eve Cone rises 150 metres above the plateau, as do aptly named Coffee and Cocoa craters. It is estimated that these cones were formed no more than 1,300 years ago and are basically unaltered by erosion and devoid of vegetation.</p>     <p>There are also five significant lakes within the park. Mowdade, Mowchilla, Kakiddi and Nuttlude form a chain along the eastern boundary, while Buckley Lake is on the northern border. All the lakes except Mowdade drain north into the Klastine River, a tributary of the Stikine.</p>     <p>To the south, Raspberry Pass separates the Edziza area from the Spectrum Range. Formed from lava flows, these mountains are named for their brilliant red, yellow, white and purple rock.This altered rhyolite resulted from staining by sulphurous mineral waters. Subsequent erosion has resulted in the combination of many hues, giving the landscape the appearance of a vast water colour. There is no vehicle access to Mount Edziza Provincial Park, and there are only a very few basic facilities. This isolated wilderness area, which can only be accessed via trails or a float plane, offers <a href=\"hikecamp.html#hiking\">wilderness camping, hiking,</a> fishing, hunting, nature study, and wildlife viewing.</p>     <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> July 27, 1972<br>      <strong>Park Size:</strong> 266,180 hectares     </p>",

This is an unmaintained roadway and there are several areas that are susceptible to overgrowth, flooding and/or washouts. Access is feasible but challenging and a 4x4 vehicle along with strong knowledge of the Willow Creek area is necessary. The official access trails in to Mt Edziza Park are unmaintained, overgrown in sections and do not have bridges over creek crossings. Visitors are asked to use caution when crossing waterways. </blockquote>If you have questions or can provide information about current conditions or hazards within Stikine Area, please contact the BC Parks Stikine Area office, at 250 771-4591. Thank you for your cooperation.</li></ul><h4>Special Notes</h4><ul><li>Any visitors wishing to fish/angle in BC Parks on the Highway 37 corridor should strongly consider obtaining a <a href=\"http://www.fishing.gov.bc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">BC Freshwater Fishing Licence</a> while they have access to internet and a printer, there are <strong>very limited</strong> opportunities to obtain a fishing licence on the Highway 37 corridor.</li><li>Mount Edziza Provincial Park is a magnificent, unspoiled wilderness that needs your help to protect it. Enjoy your visit but be sure to take special care to preserve the park&rsquo;s unique environment so that future visitors may enjoy it as you have.</li><li>Summer is short at Mount Edziza Provincial Park, where snowlingers year-round on Mount Edziza itself. Although temperatures may hitthe 30&deg;C range in mid-summer during the day, it can drop belowfreezing that same night. Snow and freezing rain are possible any dayof the year. Generally, weather suitable for backpacking occurs betweenJuly 1 and September 15. Be prepared for adverse weather conditions thatcan include white-outs and high winds. Be sure to build a weather factorinto your trip plans.</li><li>This is an isolated wilderness area with no supplies of any kind and visitors are very much on their own. Suitable clothing offering protection from wind, cold and rain are essential, as well as equipment for outdoor living. Travellers should be equipped with a compass and topographic maps (see above) for the routes they plan to travel. It should be noted, however, that on the plateau, magnetic properties in the rocks may affect the accuracy of your compass.</li><li>      High cost to government and putting others in potential danger are two great reasons for you to have a satellite communication device. Satellite communication devices are recommended when backcountry recreating. A communication device will allow you to alert others to an emergency situation or if you are overdue at your destination. This equipment is an essential part of your survival kit, and should be compatible with your activities and location.</li><li>Snow packs can obscure the trail on the plateau and cause the creeks to rise on warm days. Always use extreme caution when crossing creeks. Hiking or taking shortcuts through the lava fields is not recommended because it is very difficult and potentially unsafe.</li><li>Bear-proof containers are recommended for the safe storage of food above the tree line on the plateau area. There are bear-proof metal caches available for public use located at Mowdade and Buckley Lakes. Bears frequent the park and can be unpredictable, thus, bear deterrents such as bear spray and or bear bangers should be carried on your person at all times in case an encounter does occur.     </li></ul><h4>Stay on the trail</h4>     <ul>      <li>The volcanic cinder cones on Edziza Plateau are delicate and subject to surface scarring from foot traffic.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> On the east bank of Mess Creek and through Raspberry Pass are the remnants of the Yukon Telegraph line which was constructed to provide a communications link as far north as Dawson City during the Klondike Gold Rush. The telegraph line was in use until 1936 when it was replaced by radio.All that remains are a few poles and collapsed line cabins which once stood every 32 kilometres along the route. The trail is overgrown and no longer passable.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Prehistorically the area was heavily used by aboriginal peoples, who manufactured obsidian cutting blades and projectile points and traded them throughout northwest America.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Along the park&rsquo;s western boundary, Mess Creek flows north to enter the Stikine River three kilometres below the community of Telegraph Creek. Eleven kilometres upstream from this confluence, Mess Creek plunges into a gorge nearly 800 metres deep. To the north of the park boundary, the Stikine River, which means &ldquo;Great River&rdquo; in the language of the Tlingit Indians, has carved a tremendous, Grand Canyon-style passage through eons of volcanic and sedimentary rock deposits. Tree types and vegetation will change with elevations. Telegraph Creek to Buckley Lake area is characterized by a mosaic of shrub fields, wet grasslands and peat meadows. This zone has long, severe winters with deeply frozen soils and short growing seasons. The forests in the lower elevation valleys, Mess Creek and the Kakiddi/Klastline drainage are composed of white spruce as the dominant conifer with an intermixing of lodgepole pine and trembling aspen on the drier sites. On the wetter sites, balsam poplar is also found, in particular, adjacent to creeks, lakes and on delta soils. Between elevations of 900 and 1800 metres, the winters are cold and snowy, the summers are short and warm. The soils in this area are commonly frozen before snowfall.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Moose are probably the most common large animals in the area. Small herds of Osborn caribou may be seen in the  alpine and sub-alpine vegetation zones on the west side of the plateau between Mount Edziza and the western escarpment. Mountain goats and Stone sheep can often be viewed on the south, east and west slopes of Mount Edziza, particularly on the western escarpment and in the Spectrum Range. Visitors may encounter black and grizzly bears. Grizzlies are occasionally seen above timberline where Arctic ground squirrels are abundant. Wolves are sometimes seen or heard. Buckley Lake supports a large waterfowl and shorebird population, which are but a portion of the wide variety of bird species that can be seen in the park. The more conspicuous birds in Mount Edziza include the raven, owl, gyrfalcon, ptarmigan (willow and rock), grouse and migratory songbirds. Typical waterfowl species include goldeneye, grebe, white winged scooter and scaup.      <ul>        <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a> </li>        </ul>      </li>      </ul>",

The mountain for which the park is named guards the park&rsquo;s western entrance. At 3,954 metres, Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, towers over the lesser surrounding peaks; winter or summer, this is one of the finest&nbsp;views in the Rocky Mountains. Just as the early trappers, hunters and explorers felt in awe at the mountain&rsquo;s magnificence, travellers today experience the same feelings.</p><p>With Alberta&rsquo;s Jasper National Park as its easterly neighbour, Mount Robson Provincial Park comprises a portion of one of the world&rsquo;s largest blocks of protected areas. Designated as a part of the <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/304.htm\">Canadian Rocky Mountains World Heritage Site</a> by UNESCO in 1990, Mount Robson provides everything from developed, vehicle-accessible camping to remote valleys that seldom see a human footprint. Mount Robson Provincial Park also protects the headwaters of the Fraser River. From its pristine alpine source, the Fraser River gains strength and size to match any of the world&rsquo;s major rivers. Future genations will surely appreciate the protection of this great river&rsquo;s source within Mount Robson Park.</p><p>Flora and fauna are typical of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, North Continental Range. One is able, on some trails, to travel between three different vegetation zones during a day hike. Over 182 species of birds have been documented in the park. All wildlife indigenous in the Rocky Mountain can be found here. Mule and Whitetail Deer, Moose, Elk and Black Bear call the lower elevation home while Grizzly Bear, Caribou, Mountain Goat and Mountain Sheep inhabit the higher elevations. With over 217,000 hectares of mostly undisturbed wilderness available, wildlife populations are allowed to ebb and flow with minimal intervention by humans. There are excellent wildlife viewing opportunities throughout the park. From mountain goats on the many cliffs and rockslides to moose in Moose Marsh, the patient observer will be suitably rewarded.</p><p>First attemptedin 1907, it was not until 1913 that humans finally stood onthe summit of Mount Robson. On that clear, cold day guide ConradKain, W.W. Foster and A.H. McCarthy beheld a view no personhad ever seen before.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> March 11, 1913 <br><strong>Total Size:</strong> 225,777 hectares (Park: 225,285 hectares; Protected Areas: 492 hectares)</p><p>For 20 years, the Mountain Legacy Project (MLP), based today in the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, has been using repeat photography to examine, analyze, and understand landscape level change in the Canadian mountain west. Mt. Robson Provincial Park, with over 3 kilometres of elevation change from the valley of the Fraser River (approximately 800 m.) to the summit of Mt. Robson (3954 m), and four biogeoclimatic zones, represents a series of interconnected complex mountain ecosystems perfect for landscape level analysis. This park, with an area of roughly 2,250 km², may appear imperishable, but change is evident. Using reference photographs taken in 1911 by Arthur Wheeler, MLP teams went out in the field 100 years later to retake the images from exactly the same locations. All of the historic/modern image pairs so far completed can be seen online at <a href=\"http://explore.mountainlegacy.ca/\">explore.mountainlegacy.ca</a>. A selected group of image pairs were further segmented into land cover classifications and analyzed for change. The results, including some interesting interactive change visualizations, are available at the <a href=\"https://robsonlandscape.weebly.com/\">Visualizing 100 Years of Landscape Change website</a>.This work was completed in part through funding provided through the BC Parks <a href=\"/partnerships/living-labs/\">Living Lab for Climate Change and Conservation Program</a>.</p>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><p><strong>History:</strong> Established in 1936, the park was named for Frederick Seymour, Governor of British Columbia from 1864 to 1869. Although the first recorded climb of Mount Seymour was made in 1908 by a party from the BC Mountaineering Club, Mount Seymour was virtually unknown to most of the residents of Vancouver and vicinity until the late 1920&amp;rsquo;s. In 1929, members of the Alpine Club of Canada explored the mountain as a potential skiing area and the following year applied for a 21 year lease covering the primary skiing terrain, however the Depression years forced the club to drop the lease. In 1984 the Controlled Recreation Area and its facilities was awarded to Mt. Seymour Resorts Ltd. under a Park Use Permit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park lies in the coastal western hemlock and mountain hemlock biogeoclimatic zones. Below 1,000 metres, old-growth Douglas-fir and western red cedar are interspersed with second-growth coniferous and deciduous trees and a variety of shrubs. At 1,000 metres and above, forest cover is mostly amabilis fir, yellow cedar and mountain hemlock. Some of the higher meadows are cloaked with sub-alpine flowers, providing colourful early summer displays.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A variety of large and small mammals inhabit the park. Coyotes and deer are often seen close to the access road. Black bears, bobcats or cougars may be sighted in the backcountry. It must be strongly emphasized that bears, cougars and bobcats are wild animals and should never be approached, offered food or tormented.</p><p>Among the smaller species and birds to be found in the park are varying hare, Douglas squirrel and pine marten. The Canada jay, identified by its raucous call and social manners, is a frequent visitor to hikers&rsquo; lunching spots. Other indigenous birds include the raven, Steller&rsquo;s jay (the official bird of British Columbia), chickadee, kinglet, sapsucker, grouse and siskin. During their annual fall migration, several species of hawks may be spotted.</p></li></ul>",

Spectacular folded mountains, bountiful wildlife, brilliantly-colored wildflowers are just a few of the wonders to discover here. In the southern portion of the park, you will see the very impressive geological formations of Folded Mountain towering above the road. Tectonic deformations have folded the limestone giving these mountains their unique appearance. Further along the highway you will have the opportunity to travel across the alluvial fans. Caution should be used if investigating these wonders of nature. Rain high up in the mountains may cause flooding of these areas with little or no warning. Keep an eye open for moose which frequent the many swamps within the park.</p><p>Twelve kilometres of jade-colored water will tell you that you have reached Muncho Lake. You have the choice of camping at Strawberry Flats campground or at MacDonald campground, 11 km further north.The lake&rsquo;s cold, deep waters, tinted green by minerals, are home to lake trout, arctic grayling, bull trout and whitefish. Toss out a line and try your luck.</p><p>There is an excellent chance you will see stone sheep along the highway. Be sure to check your rear-view mirror before hitting the brakes and give motorists&rsquo; ample warning of your intention to stop.

Nadina means \"standing up alone\" in the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en language, referring to the prominent, solitary aspect of the mountain.<br>  <br>  This park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.</li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> Located within the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en First Nation traditional territory, Nadina Mountain Park is in the Bi Wini house territory, in the house of Keexwinits (House in the Middle of Many) that belongs to the Gitdumden (Bear/Wolf) clan. Naydeena (Nadina) Mountain is a place where Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en people would go to hunt caribou, dutney (groundhog or marmot) and klayyul (mountain goat). Caribou would be snared, with the snare tied to a piece of wood. The wood would be dragged around after the caribou was caught in the snare. When the animal tired of towing the wood or the wood was tangled in trees or rocks it was harvested with spears or arrows.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The conservation role of Nadina Mountain Park is to protect a unique isolated granitic mountain and its associated natural values, including:      <ul> <li>Mountain goats</li> <li>Grizzly bears</li> <li>Lichen communities</li> <li>Granitic spires.</li></ul>Nadina Mountain Park provides important habitat for wildlife that live in and around the park. Mountain goats from Nadina Mountain may disperse to other nearby areas such as Poplar Mountain, Morice Mountain, and Foxy Creek.<br><br>Vegetation below tree line is primarily subalpine fir although rare whitebark pine ecosystems also occur. The expansive alpine tundra has a diverse community of lichen species. Most of the low elevation northwest portion of the park consists of wetland habitat.<br><br>Nadina Mountain Park also provides important ecosystem services (the benefits that people receive from ecosystems) that include clean water, natural flood control, carbon storage, air purification, nutrient cycling, food, biodiversity, recreation, aesthetic experience and spiritual experience.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A significant population of mountain goats make Nadina Mountain their home. Tufts of goat hair are to be found on rocks along the route to the summit and viewing opportunities are plentiful. Do not approach or attempt to feed the goats, please maintain a respectful distance. Other species commonly observed in the area are black bear, ground squirrels, marmots and deer. Park users should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment.

After earthflows occurred depressions were left at the landslide sites. Wetlands developed in areas where the depressions were lower than the permanent water table. These have since developed into a series of raised acidic bogs, formed from the gradual build-up of organic material. The sphagnum peat in the bog is between 2.3 and 4-m thick. This organic bog material has been carbon-dated to determine the timing of the earthflows. The earthflows are thought to have occurred between 1500 and 2650 years ago.<br>      <br>One Provincially Blue-listed vascular plant has been reported in the Nalbeelah Creek Wetlands, the Bog adder&rsquo;s-mouth orchid (Malaxsis paludosa).

Indigenous middens offer mute evidence of at least two Salish villages, which were deserted before the discovery of coal in this area in 1849.

The island became very popular for company picnics and Sunday outings, with ships from Vancouver bringing as many as 1,500 people at a time.

Although the Salish were among the island&rsquo;s first coal miners, they were soon &ldquo;supplemented&rdquo; by boatloads of British; these men christened the island after a famous coal town in northern England and diligently worked the mines until 1883. Newcastle Island&rsquo;s supplies of sandstone lasted longer than did the coal: this attractive building material, used in many constructions along the west coast, was quarried from 1869 until 1932.</p><p>Newcastle Island also played a role in the fishing industry of the province. By 1910 the Japanese, who dominated fisheries, had established a small settlement just north of Shaft Point on the west side of the island. Here they operated a saltery and shipyard until 1941 when all the Japanese-Canadians who lived along the coast were sent to internment camps in the Interior in the interests of national security during wartime.</p><p>In 1931, the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company purchased the island and operated it as a pleasure resort, building a dance pavilion (now the visitor centre), teahouse, picnic areas, change-houses, soccer field and a wading pool.

The lava travelled at different speeds      depending on the steepness of the slope.

Legend has it that children had shown disrespect to the life-giving salmon by putting stones and burning sticks into their backs and watching them swim. The elders warned the children repeatedly to stop but they did not listen. Soon the ground began to rumble. The volcano and the lava flow then covered the valley bottom, redirected the mighty Nass River and destroyed two villages.

Forests in the valley bottoms are dominated by white spruce and aspen, and are replaced by sub-alpine fir and white spruce at higher elevations. Alpine plant communities consist of dwarf willows, grasses, sedges, forbs and lichens. The park also has numerous wetlands and native grasslands. Old growth white spruce forests can be found along the major river valley bottoms.</p></li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A diverse variety of wildlife inhabits this northeastern mountain landscape. The area provides high quality habitat for moose, elk, stone sheep and mountain goat. The abundance of prey supports predator species such as wolves and grizzly and black bears. Other important wildlife includes furbearers such as marten, fisher, weasels and wolverines. Information on small mammals, amphibians, birds, invertebrates and reptiles is relatively unknown. Lake trout, rainbow trout, bull trout, arctic grayling and lake whitefish are some of the important sport fish species in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park.</li>    </ul>",

In the late fifties,    thousands of non-native trees were planted on a barren hillside between the highway and the lake. Today, this area is a natural arboretum and the    extensive tree cover is home to various bird types.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Though the campground areas are dotted with irrigated lawn and non-native trees, the park still falls    into two basic zones with bunchgrass found in exposed areas at low elevations and stands of Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir found in the upper    sections. Many wildflowers can be seen along the nature trail away from the more developed areas of the park. Of special note are the Chocolate lily and the Columbian lily.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The close proximity of the highway and the fencing on the uphill side prevent movement of large    mammals such as deer into the campground. Though sightings of large mammals may be infrequent, the park still has a variety of wildlife to see. Harmless gopher snakes and colonies of Columbian ground squirrels can be seen along upland hiking trails. Bats are quite common in areas bordering lakes and may be seen from the park, though they generally prefer areas with less human presence. The Western toad and Western painted turtle have been spotted in the park which also provides habitat for a variety of birds such as Cedar waxwings, quail, Northern shafted flickers, Western meadowlarks, hummingbirds and a blue listed bird species, the Lewis&rsquo;s woodpecker. Insect life is extremely diverse in the park with the Ant Lion being, perhaps, the most interesting. They live buried in conical shaped traps in the sand in ambush for other insects.</li></ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> This park was established August 23, 1973.</li><li><p><strong>Culture:</strong> The colourful history of the Okanagan Valley is very evident in the park. There are archaeological sites and provincially significant First Nations pictographs found on rock outcrops and canyon walls. At one time, the local Salish Indians used Wild Horse Canyon as a wild-horse trap.</p><p>Historic trails form part of the current trail network, some dating back to 1860, when Father Pandosy established an oblate mission near Kelowna. Settlers used a trail through Wild Horse Canyon, but finding the south end of the trail crossed extremely rough and rocky country, Father Pandosy instituted a better trail higher up to the east.</p><p>Good&rsquo;s Creek Canyon Trail was named for Dave Good, supplier of survey crews for the Kettle Valley Railway, built in 1915. Commando Bay was used to secretly train Chinese-Canadians for guerrilla warfare in 1944, during World War II.</p><p>Little remains at the crash site of a DC3 passenger plane that went down in December of 1950 roughly one km northeast of Divide Lake. The two CP Air pilots died in the crash, while 16 others on board were rescued by local search and rescue teams. There is no trail access to the site.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park is a representative example of the Okanagan Basin and Okanagan Highlands. The terrain ranges from the deeply incised melt water channels of Good Creek and Wildhorse Canyon to the 1579m high Okanagan Mountain with spectacular examples of heavily glaciated rock terrain including classic rock drumlins, grooves, flutes and striations.</p><p>The park encompasses ecosystems from three different biogeoclimatic zones: the bunchgrass zone in some of the lower but more exposed areas, the ponderosa pine zone in much of the lower elevations and the interior Douglas fir zone on the upper mountain reaches. Significant old growth Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce covers more than 2500 hectares. The park&rsquo;s plant life represents the influence of both the dry southern and wetter northern climates. The park protects a significant portion of undeveloped lakeshore along Okanagan Lake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The variety of ecosystems represented in the park leads to an abundance of wildlife that is surprising in an area so close to Kelowna.</p><p>The rugged rocky terrain is habitat for mountain goats. White-tailed deer, moose, elk, lynx, marten, coyote are also found in the park. Small but very important species are the blue listed Western harvest mouse, Nuttall&rsquo;s cottontail (the furthest northerly occurrence) and Spotted bat. The Northern alligator lizard and Western skink can be found under rocks or bark in open wooded areas while the Yellow-bellied racer prefers grasslands and open fields.</p><p>Blue listed reptile species found in the park include Western painted turtle, Rubber boa, Gopher snake, Western blue racer and Western rattlesnake. The park protects habitat for five blue and two red listed bird species including the Western grebe and Whiteheaded woodpecker.</p></li></ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>     <li><strong>History:</strong> Originally named Goose Lake, Old Man Lake was renamed in 1936 in honour of an elderly settler that lived in the local area.<br><br>An earthen berm dam and overflow channel were constructed in 1987 just downstream of the western park boundary in order to create higher water levels to enhance waterfowl habitat in the Old Man Lake system. In 2009, actions to remove the dam were initiated because of erosion of the overflow channel. The dam has now been completely removed resulting in lower water levels in the lake chain.<br><br> This park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.<br>     </li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> The park lies in the Tze Zul and Gguzih Keyikh house territories within the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en territory. The Tze Zul house territory is in the house of Ginehklaiyex (House of Many Eyes) that belongs to the Laksilyu (Small Frog) clan. The Gguzih Keyikh house territory is in the house of Kayex (Birchbark House) that belongs to the Gilseyhyu (Big Frog) clan.<br><br>Contributing to the parks cultural significance is the abundance of berry thickets on the south-facing natural grasslands including Saskatoon berries, huckleberries, cranberries and blueberries. The area also has abundant moose, and is known for wild rice (Fritillaria camschatcensis) and wild celery. <br><br>The cultural heritage role for Old Man Lake Park is to provide a connection to place for the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en Nation. Cultural heritage on the land is the essence of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en identity.<br></li>    <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Old Man Lake Park protects rare wetland ecosystems that offer high value breeding and migratory bird habitat. Red listed Saskatoon Slender wheatgrass grasslands are also protected along with south facing grassland slopes that provide high quality ungulate winter range. Additionally, the park contains a high diversity of berry producing shrubs and food producing plants that are historically important to the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en First Nation.<br>    </li>    <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Old Man Lake Park provides important habitat for wildlife that live in and around the park and contains important ungulate winter range. Lower snow depths are important for moose and deer. American Bitterns (blue-listed) have been heard in the Old Man Lake area and are suspected to be breeding in the park. Trumpeter Swans are known to breed in the park and a garter snake winter den has been noted in the park. The area is routinely used as a stopover by migratory birds and contains locally rare breeding populations of Black Tern and Yellow-headed Blackbird. Peregrine Falcons (red-listed) have been observed preying on waterfowl in the Old Man Lake/China Nose area. The cliffs on China Nose Mountain are an ideal nesting location for Peregrine Falcons with good access to prey in Old Man Lake Park. Old Man Lake is eutrophic, and vulnerable to winter kill due to its shallowness and extremely abundant growth of aquatic weeds. Suitable habitat for Rainbow Trout is present.</li>   </ul>",

They named it &ldquo;Encampment des Femmes&rdquo; after the women who waited for their men out trapping or on the brigades.

Stone conducted expeditions into the Cassiar to collect specimens for the American Museum of Natural History. With his announcements of the discovery of several &ldquo;new&rdquo; species of sheep and caribou, the area became a destination for hunters. Local natives worked as hunting guides and camps were set up throughout the region.

Windy and James Bays hold high cultural,                   heritage and fisheries values for the Kitasoo/XaiXais                   First Nation. The Kitasoo people have traditionally                   used Pooley Island for berry picking, collecting                   medicines, and gathering wood for crafts and housing.                   The area is also a traditional hunting and fishing                   area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong>                  The primary role of the Pooley Conservancy                  is to maintain wolf/deer interactions and habitat                  values. The conservancy maintains watershed integrity                  along with Kermode bear habitat values. The productive                  estuaries at Windy and James Bays are protected within                  the conservancy along with important fisheries values. </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Often                seen feeding in the scenic estuaries of this conservancy                are black bears and the famous kermode bear who inhabit                the inland. The conservancy is also home to a population                of grey wolves which prey upon the island&rsquo;s deer                population. Numerous salmon species utilize the main                creeks of James and Windy Bays for spawning grounds.</li>      <li><a href=\"../../wild_gen.html\">General                   Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>      </ul>",

William Rath, a gold prospector, arrived in 1886 with his young wife and baby daughter. They built a log cabin, cleared the land, and in 1895 they built the barn. William died in 1903, leaving Elizabeth the farm and five children. She proved to be an industrious person, successfully running the farm and eventually operating it as a campground. The suffix &ldquo;trevor&rdquo; was added to give the campground a more lyrical name. Rathtrevor Campground became Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park in 1967 and though much has changed since William and Elizabeth first arrived, its beauty and importance will be preserved for our continued enjoyment.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Several species of wildlife can be seen in the park, including deer, raccoons, squirrels, otters, mink, eagles, osprey, hawks, vultures, owls, and many shore and migratory birds that use the park area during their spring and fall migrations.

Since then the area has been the stage for a great deal of activity. In the early 1900s the lake was used as a holding pond for shingle bolts (short logs). A wooden flume sped the bolts 5 km downhill to the Stoltze mill at nearby Ruskin. In the early 1930s, the park area supported a small Japanese-Canadian hand logging operation typical of many that existed throughout the province. If you look closely within the surrounding second growth forest, you may find some of the wooden flumes used to float the bolts, or a plank road of the latter logging days.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> This area was once used by the Sto:lo of the Coast Salish Nation.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park lies within the wet subzone of the Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone.

In the 1930&rsquo;s, the area was used as a relief camp for the workers building Highway 99. In 1976 the area was purchased by Carling O&rsquo;Keefe Brewery, who used the pure mountain water to brew their beer, and made the area a logging show park. In 1982 O&rsquo;Keefe donated the land to BC Parks. Throughout the park area there is evidence of logging activity that occurred here roughly 90 years ago. A number of excellent spring board notches on old stumps are scattered throughout the forested area and much of the deadfall also exhibits evidence of the logging techniques of this period.</li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> This park holds significant spiritual value to the Squamish First Nation, the first people to live in this area. They told of a two headed sea serpent, Say-noth-ka who lived in and around Howe Sound. According to legend this beast travelled both on land and in water. Some versions say it was Say-noth-ka who formed Shannon Falls by slithering and twisting his powerful body up the mountainside on repeated expeditions, Say-noth-ka gradually wore down a spillway for those cascading waters.</li></ul>",

The lush green lawns of Skihist have always invited travellers to stop and relax from the heat of the summer. The park preserves a section of the historic Cariboo Wagon road. The starting point of the road was in Yale and construction of the road took place between 1862 and 1865. The road was a narrow, treacherous track winding along the cliffs of the canyon and allowed stagecoaches and freight wagons access to the BC interior. The road linked the gold fields of the Cariboo to Vancouver.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> BC Parks uses prescribed burns as a conservation tool. The intense build-up of Ponderosa pine needles on the forest floor in Skihist park could contribute to a catastrophic fire, should one occur. The needles also change the PH balance of the soil, restricting growth of grasses and plants. Prescribed burns are used in the campground to eliminate the needle build-up and provide opportunities for new growth.<p>Which plants can you identify?

The park was originally included as part of the Sechelt Provincial forest in 1934 and remained provincial forest until the 1950&rsquo;s when the Department of Recreation and Conservation studied the recreational and tourism potential of the site. As a result, the outstanding scenic and interesting features of the rapids (covering 40.5 ha) were removed from the provincial forest and established as a Class A park. Over the years, more area has been added to the park, to bring it to its current size of 123 hectares.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> This park protects south coast inlet shoreline, small islets, a small lake, maturing second growth    hemlock and the phenomenal rapids.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Birds, ground squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, sea stars, urchin, anemone, chiton, flounder, red snapper, ling and rock cod, salmon species, crab, oysters, clams and mussels can all be found in the park. <br>       An abundance of marine life is found in the ocean area around the park.

Located almost in the centre of Vancouver Island, Strathcona park is a rugged mountain wilderness comprising more than 250,000 hectares. Mountain peaks &ndash; some perpetually mantled with snow &ndash; dominate the park. Lakes and alpine tarns dot a landscape laced with rivers, creeks and streams. Summer in Strathcona is usually pleasantly warm, while winters are fairly mild except for the higher levels, where heavy snowfalls are the norm. From November through March, snowfalls can be expected on the mountain slopes and alpine plateaus. Snow remains all year on the mountain peaks and may linger into July even at moderate elevations. Summer evenings, as elsewhere in the coastal regions of B.C., can be cool and rain can be expected at any time of the year.</p><p>Two areas &ndash; Buttle Lake and vicinity, and Forbidden Plateau &ndash; offer a variety of visitor-oriented developments. The rest of the park is largely undeveloped and appeals primarily to people seeking wilderness surroundings. To see and enjoy much of the scenic splendor requires hiking or backpacking into the alpine regions.</p><p>Buttle Lake, named for Commander John Buttle who explored the area in the 1860s, is the major body of water in the park. It and many other lakes and waterways in the park can provide good fishing in season for Cutthroat, Rainbow and Dolly Varden trout. Della Falls, whose drop of 440 metres over three cascades makes it one of the highest waterfalls in Canada, is located in the southern remote section of the park with the trailhead only accessible by boat at the northwest end of Great Central Lake. And the highest point on Vancouver Island, the Golden Hinde (elevation 2,200 metres), stands almost in the centre of Strathcona to the west of Buttle Lake.</p><p>Three roadless tracts within Strathcon Provincial Park &ndash; Big Den, Central Strathcona and Comox Glacier--have been designated as nature conservancy areas. Each tract contains outstanding examples of scenery and natural history that remain uninfluenced by human activity. The three areas, totalling 122,500 hectares, are dedicated to the preservation of the undisturbed natural environment.</p><p>While the high mountain peaks and deep shaded valleys of Strathcona Park are dramatic, it is easy to forget that beneath your feet lays a history stretching back 380 million years. It is a history of violent volcanic eruptions on ancient seafloors and quiet interludes when gardens of sea lilies waved in gentle ocean currents. It is a history of rocks torn and folded by the extraordinary forces that can move continents, and of mountain ranges sculpted by the immensely thick ice sheets, which only vanished a few thousand years ago. No matter how long your visit, or whatever your interest, a knowledge of the <a href=\"http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/MINING/GEOSCIENCE/PUBLICATIONSCATALOGUE/INFORMATIONCIRCULARS/IC1995-07/Pages/GeologicalHistory.aspx\">geology of Strathcona Park</a> will enhance your enjoyment of this spectacularly beautiful area.</p><p>Strathcona Park benefits from excellent adjoining commercial facilities such as the Strathcona Park Lodge and Outdoor Education Centre, which offers outdoor education and wilderness skills training. The nearby communities of Campbell River, the Comox Valley, Gold River, Tofino and Port Alberni offer a full range of visitor services. Mount Washington Alpine Resort, located adjacent to the park, offers extensive alpine and nordic skiing opportunities, as well as a variety of winter and summer recreation facilities.</p><p>The <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/strath_mt/\">Megin-Talbot addition</a> in Strathcona Provincial Park was identified for protection in the Clayoquot Sound Land-Use  Decision in 1995.</p><p><strong>Date Established:</strong> March 1, 1911 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 248,669 hectares (247,961 hectares of upland and 708 hectares of foreshore)</p>",

Throughout the summer months the park offers a spectacular floral display in various areas from sea level to above 1,800 metres elevation. Found at varying heights are varieties of heather, lupine, monkey flowers and violets as well as Indian paintbrush, phlox and moss campion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Vancouver Island&rsquo;s separation from mainland British Columbia by Johnstone and Georgia Straits means that many mammal species common to other parts of the province are not found on the Island. Species such as the Roosevelt elk, the currently-endangered Vancouver Island marmot, the Vancouver Island wolf, and the coastal black-tailed deer are different from their mainland relatives. The park has a large deer population and a significant number of Roosevelt elk while wolves and cougars, though present, are seldom seen. Resident birds include the chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, winter wren and kinglet, as well as the gray jay, Steller&rsquo;s jay and band-tailed pigeon. The park also supports numerous blue grouse, ruffled grouse and a limited number of unique Vancouver Island white-tailed ptarmigan.</p><ul><li><a href=\"docs/strathcona-marmots.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Poster: Reintroducing Vancouver Island Marmots to Strathcona Provincial Park <span class=\"fileinfo\">[PDF]</span></a></li></ul></li></ul>",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> The park was established on December 3, 1975. Named for the region of the province that it occupies, Spatsizi means &ldquo;red goat&rdquo; in the Tahltan First Nation language. It was a name given to the mountain goats of the area because of their habit of rolling in the iron oxide-coloured dust, which changed their normally white coats to red.<br><br>Historically, Spatsizi was the hunting ground of the Tahltan First Nation. It was seldom visited by outsiders prior to 1926, when the  Hyland brothers established a post on the Spatsizi River to trade with native fur trappers. In 1948, Tommy Walker set up permanent hunting and fishing camps  at Hyland Post and Cold Fish Lake, hiring local Caribou Hide Indians as guides. It was largely due to the efforts of Walker that the park and Gladys Lake  Ecological Reserve were created in 1975.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> This park spreads across two broad physiographic regions, the Spatsizi Plateau and the Skeena Mountains. The plateau, a rolling upland, ranges in elevation from 1,600 to 2,000 metres, and extends in a broad curve broken by wide &ldquo;u&rdquo; shaped valleys. The Eaglenest Range of the Skeena Mountains&nbsp;dominates the northwest. Its highest peak, Mt. Will (2,500 metres) towers above Gladys Lake.<br><br>A portion of the central part of the park just south of Cold Fish Lake has been designated as the Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve. The reserve was created for the study of stone sheep and mountain goats in an undisturbed habitat. Persons wishing to view these animals may hike the reserve.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Lands within the park have an excellent capability for supporting large populations of wildlife. The light  snow depths in the rain shadow of the Eaglenest Range create one of the most important habitats for woodland caribou in British Columbia. The Spatsizi River  Valley, with its many flooded areas and oxbow ponds, provides aquatic vegetation for summer forage as well as willow flats for winter browse for moose. Grizzly  and black bears, wolverines, beaver, hoary marmot, and Arctic ground squirrels are fairly abundant and more than 140 species of birds including gyrfalcons,  Smith&rsquo;s longspurs and American Golden Plovers have been recorded within the park boundaries.</li></ul>",

Known as the &ldquo;people of the lower drainage&rdquo; the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en have been living in this part of the continent since time immemorial. Within the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en territory, Atna River Park lies in the C&rsquo;iniggit Nenik&euml;kh house territory in the house of Yextsowiten (Thin House) that belongs to the Gilseyhyu (Big Frog) clan. <br><br>Mt. Loring (Leez Be&rsquo;h) was utilized in times of need by all Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en clans and the Gitxsan to harvest Hoary Marmot and Caribou. C&rsquo;iniggit Nenik&euml;kh house territory played a critical role for the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en and is known as &ldquo;Common Basket&rdquo;. This area is known to be very productive for resources and remains important to the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en today.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Atna River Park is significant in the parks and protected areas system because it:<ol><li>protects a pristine ecosystem transitional between the coast and interior, including regionally rare old-growth coastal forest and wetland ecosystems;</li><li>significantly contributes to the protection of the moist cool subzone of the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir biogeoclimatic subzone;</li><li>protects a tributary of the Morice River, a provincially significant salmon and steelhead river;</li><li>protects important grizzly bear and mountain goat habitat, sockeye salmon spawning areas and whitebark pine ecosystems;</li><li>protects a remote pristine wilderness;</li><li>protects part of a much larger park complex that includes Morice Lake and Nenik&euml;kh/Nanika-Kidprice parks; and,</li><li>protects part of the C&rsquo;iniggit Nenik&euml;kh house territory, which is known as &ldquo;Common Basket&rdquo; and which played a critical role for the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en.</li></ol>Atna River Park also provides important ecosystem services (the benefits that people receive from ecosystems) that include clean water, natural flood control, carbon storage, air purification, nutrient cycling, food, biodiversity, recreation, aesthetic experience and spiritual experience. The park plays an important role in regulating water quantity, water temperature, and release of spring melt waters, which is important for both fish habitat and downstream water users.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Atna River Park provides important habitat for wildlife that live in and around the park. Atna River Park contains moderate to high value grizzly bear and summer and fall habitat and high quality mountain goat winter range.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> The park was established on November 22, 1995, following a 25 year debate over development versus protection. The name comes from the Nlaka&rsquo;pamux word &ldquo;Stagyn,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;hidden place,&rdquo; referring to the fact that the valley and the extent of the watershed is not very noticeable from the Stein River&rsquo;s mouth on the Fraser River. The valley has been extremely important to the Nlaka&rsquo;pamux people for thousands of years, both spiritually and for sustenance. Since the establishment of the park the Stein is managed via the Stein Valley Co-Operative Management Agreement between the Lytton First Nation and the Province of BC &ndash; on the Stein Management Board. The function of the Management Board is to oversee and provide management direction for all initiatives and undertakings related to the planning, operation and management of the Park. This arrangement also provides the park with two seasonal full-time Wardens who assist both the users of the park as well as maintaining values within the park particularly in the lower Stein. Please ensure all your activities within the park are respectful and you practice a &ldquo;leave no trace&rdquo; philosophy.</li>       <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Stein Valley straddles the transition from the dry interior to the wetter Coastal Mountains. This, combined with the large elevational gradient, has resulted in very diverse vegetation communities within the park. Dry ponderosa pine forests characterize the lower valley, while Douglas fir is predominant in the mid-valley and hemlock, cedar, spruce and fir become predominant in the western end of the valley. Patches of cedar exist throughout the valley, even at the eastern end in moist, cool locations along creeks such as Stryen and Teaspoon. Floodplain forests along the river are dominated by black cottonwood mixed with aspen and birch. Higher elevations are noted for stands of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, and above those are white bark pine and alpine tundra. Spectacular flower blooms occur in the spring and summer, particularly at higher elevations.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Due to its size and relative lack of disturbance, the park contains populations of many species of wildlife that indicate its relative health as wilderness. It is thought to contain over 50 species of mammals, including mountain goat, cougar, wolverine, black bear and grizzly bear. Bird species include golden eagles, sharp shinned hawks, barred owls, pigmy owls, white-tailed ptarmigan, pileated woodpeckers and rufous hummingbirds, as well as several species of chickadees, warblers and nuthatches. The Stein River contains dolly varden char, rainbow trout and Rocky Mountain whitefish, as well as steelhead trout, coho, pink and chinook salmon that return to the river at certain times of the year to spawn.</li>    </ul>",

Mining began in 1966 and will continue dependant on reserves and commodity prices.</li><li><strong>Conservation/Wildlife:</strong> The lower portion of Thelwood Creek has spawning beds for Rainbow, Dolly Varden and Cutthroat trout, as well as char. These spawning areas are essential to maintaining the fishery of Buttle Lake in Strathcona Provincial Park. The park also protects important habitat for Roosevelt elk and beaver. Strathcona-Westmin Provincial Park has a significant black bear population. It is common to encounter bears along the trails and roadsides. Other wildlife in the park includes the red-listed Vancouver Island wolverine, as well as cougars, deer, wolves and a variety of birds and amphibians.</li></ul>",

These long, narrow  lakes are among the region&rsquo;s most significant recreational features. The lakes offer great sports fishing opportunities for rainbow and lake trout, burbot,  kokanee, and mountain whitefish. The chain is also part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British Columbia. With more than 630 km  of lakeshore to explore, few developed facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote wilderness experience. A series of small  parks have been established along the system providing protected anchorages or attractive beaches. No facilities have been developed at these sites.<br>     <br>     Stuart Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in the province at 90 km long with 270 km of shoreline. The community of Fort St. James is located on the southeast end. The main body of the lake is between 6 to 10 km wide and is road accessible at many locations. The northwestern arm of the lake is narrower, has limited road access, and more of a wilderness feel. This portion of the lake is very scenic with numerous bays, points, and islands. Wildlife  viewing, boating, hunting, and angling are popular pursuits in the area.<br>    <br>     Stuart Lake Marine Park consists of three lakeside sites protected as part of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. Stuart Lake Park is also on the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. These sites provide no facilities, but may offer protected anchorages or sandy beaches.<br>     <br>     The  Tachie River connects Stuart Lake to Trembleur Lake. The 26 km of river can be a challenge to navigate with fast water and small rapids. Trembleur Lake is almost 50 km long. It has an irregular shoreline with sheltered bays and coves and a scenic wilderness setting. There is one marine park site on Trembleur  Lake.<br>     <br>    The Middle River flows from Takla Lake into Trembleur Lake. The river, designated as a Provincial Heritage River, is 22 km long and navigable.  At 96 km in length, Takla is the fifth largest lake in the province. Almost 250 km of undisturbed shoreline with sandy beaches and isolated bays are available  to explore. There are three marine park sites on Takla Lake. There is sporadic road access on the east side of the lake.<br>     <br>     NTS map references:<br><ul><li>Stuart Lake &ndash; 93K/7, 93K/8, 93K/9, 93K/10, 93K/11</li><li>Tachie River &ndash; 93K/10 &amp; 93K/15 </li><li>Trembleur Lake &ndash; 93K14 &amp; 93K/15 </li><li>Middle River &ndash; 93K/14 </li><li>Takla Lake &ndash; 93M/1, 93M/8, 93M/9, 93N/3, 93N/4, 93N/5</li></ul>  <strong>Park Size:</strong> <ul>    <li>Stuart Lake Marine Park &ndash; 227 hectares</li>    <li>Two Islands Site &ndash; 134 hectares (small coarse sand beach &amp; anchorage site)</li><li>Stuart Lake Park &ndash; 343 hectares (sandy beach; shallow bay)</li><li>Jus K&rsquo;etl&rsquo;o Bay &ndash; 70 hectares 9 rocky or grass shoreline; attractive sheltered bay)</li><li>North Arm &ndash; 23 hectares (pebble beach &amp; grass shoreline; attractive sheltered bay with two small islands offshore)</li></ul>     <strong>Stay Safe: </strong>     <ul>      <li>Boaters are cautioned to keep a close eye on the weather as Stuart Lake is subject to sudden heavy winds that can transform the lake into dangerous whitecaps.

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> For many years prior to the arrival of European explorers, the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area was home to the Dakelh-ne people. In 1806, Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to this area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company.<br>      <br>      The company merged with the  Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James. Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley.<br>      <br>With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area that has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing, and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Although settled by Europeans almost 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for years prior. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlatch could be held.<br>      <br> The Carrier people traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.<br>      <br> Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak&rsquo;azdli, Yekoochet&rsquo;en, Takla, and Tl&rsquo;azt&rsquo;en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The three small sites of Stuart Lake Marine Park and Stuart Lake Park protect natural areas and contribute to the role of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other more secretive species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear. Furbearers in the area include lynx, fox, beaver, marten,  fisher, otter, and wolverine.</li>     </ul>",

First established in 1968 to provide recreational opportunities, the park was increased to its present size in 1995 to protect a provincially significant ecosystem.</li>      <li>       <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> This area is significant to the Okanagan, Shuswap, Sinixt, and Ktunaxa/Kinbasket First Nations. It encompasses areas of cultural and spiritual values.      </li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The moderately dry and warm climate of this part of the West Kootenay is conducive to the growth of plants and trees like bunchgrass and ponderosa pine that are not normally found in the region. It contains beaches, grasslands, open and closed pine forest, rock outcroppings and canyons. It is important seasonal range for rocky mountain bighorn sheep, elk, deer and cougar. Many bird species inhabit the parks&rsquo; forest and grasslands including white-throated swifts, canyon wrens nesting in the rock bands and great blue heron at the waters edge.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Park users should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment.

In 1806 Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to the area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company.<br>     <br>The company merged with the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James. Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia and said to be the oldest European-settled community in British Columbia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley. With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area that has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing, and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Although settled by Europeans almost 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for years prior. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlach could be held.<br>      <br>The Carrier people traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.<br>     <br>     Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak&rsquo;azdli, Yekoochet&rsquo;en, Takla, and Tl&rsquo;azt&rsquo;en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The three small sites of Takla Lake Marine Park protect natural areas and contribute to the role of the Stuart &ndash; Trembleur &ndash; Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations.

Tatshenshini-Alsek Park contains nearly one million hectares of glacier-cloaked peaks, wild rivers, grizzly bears and unusual plant  communities. Situated in the very northwest corner of British Columbia, it nestles between Kluane National Park and Reserves in the Yukon and Glacier Bay  &amp; Wrangell-St. Elias National Parks and Preserves in Alaska. Combined, these parks comprise the largest protected area in the world, approximately 8.5  million hectares. The Tatshenshini-Alsek Park has been designated as a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/72.htm\" target=\"_blank\">World Heritage Site</a> by UNESCO. The  Alsek and Tatshenshini rivers are responsible for much of what&rsquo;s special in the area. The great gap they&rsquo;ve carved through the coastal mountains allows cool, moist ocean air into the cold interior. The quick change from ocean to interior environment, frequent floods, landslides and avalanches, a varied geology and great elevation changes have together created an exceptionally diverse range of habitat conditions.</p>    <p>     Despite its remote location the ruggedly beautiful Tatshenshini-Alsek region is attracting an increasing number of recreationalists: <a href=\"rafting_kayaking.html\" target=\"_blank\">kayakers and rafters</a> are drawn to the two magnificent river systems; <a href=\"hiking_biking.html\" target=\"_blank\">hikers</a> and mountaineers confront a near-endless pristine wilderness that includes everything from alpine  meadows to the jagged edges of the Alsek Ranges and Mt. Fairweather, the province&rsquo;s highest peak at 4,633 metres; and <a href=\"hiking_biking.html\" target=\"_blank\">mountain bikers</a> can explore old mining roads and other interesting and challenging terrain. Interestingly, the Haines Highway provides an opportunity to see much of the same unusual plant and animal diversity that river users experience.</p>    <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> October 15, 1993     <br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 947,026 hectares<br>    </p>",
      "SafetyInfo": "<h4>Stay Safe</h4>    <ul>     <li>Visitors to Tatshenshini-Alsek Park should be aware that this is a rugged wilderness area; appropriate clothing, camping gear and sufficient supplies are a necessity. If planning to hike or mountain bike, it is important to remember that weather conditions in the summer are highly variable. Although a day may start with clear skies and sunshine, it can quickly change, and snow is possible any day of the year. High winds are frequent and there are often long spells of cold, wet weather.    </li>     <li>Rafters must be aware that the remoteness of this park is an <strong>essential</strong> factor to consider in trip preparation and safety. The exception to the level of difficulty is Turnback Canyon on the Alsek River. This section of the river is <strong>extremely hazardous at all water levels </strong>and travel is <strong>not recommended</strong> for even the most skilled rafter/kayaker. <strong>Portaging is recommended for all trips. </strong>      <p>   </li>    </ul>    <h4>Special Notes<br>     </h4><ul><li>Comprehensive archaeological studies of the Alsek and Tatshenshini River corridors are not yet complete. If you come across a site or artifact of cultural significance you are encouraged to report its location and what you saw to the BC Parks office in Atlin at (250) 651-7634. Please remember that it is an offence to damage or remove any natural or cultural resource from a Provincial Park.</li>   <li>Despite the great diversity of life found in the Tatshenshini, existence for its inhabitants can be a fragile one. Winters are long, the growing season is short and damaged vegetation rehabilitates slowly. This is one reason why <strong>no motorized vehicles are allowed off the highway</strong>, except in the winter when snowmobiling is <strong> allowed within a specified area.</strong> Visitors are asked to take special care to minimize impact on the landscape. Please pack out your litter and plan any camping or campfires so there is no evidence of your passage. This will ensure that future travelers will experience the same wilderness that you do.</li></ul>",

With the European demand for fur, trappers moved into the area during the early 1800&rsquo;s. Since that time the popularity of the area has increased with hunting, fishing, and recreational boating avidly pursued. The significance of the hot springs first prompted the area to be set aside as a recreation reserve. The hot springs were then proposed as an ecological reserve in 1974. Site surveys were undertaken by B.C. Hydro in the early 1980s as part of the Liard River investigations. The Fort Nelson Land and Resource Management Plan recommended the area in 1997 as a Protected Area due to the regionally significant hot springs for wildlife, viewing, hiking and First Nations values.

The lower river bars around the springs are covered by shrubby vegetation such as glaucous-leaved honeysuckle, common snowberry, western choke cherry and    silverberry. The higher terrace hosts alluvial poplar forests with luxurious herb layers that are mainly the result of nutrient enrichment caused by animals visiting the mineral lick. These hot springs are an important mineral lick used by moose and other ungulates.</li>       <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A diverse variety of wildlife species utilize the area.

Sitka alder is common in the lower reaches of the Summer Creek drainage and is found along the Lussier River and around Fish Lake. Near the timber line, alpine larch and white bark pine are interspersed with fir and spruce.<br>      <br>Alpine flowers carpet much of the plateau in July and early August, with glacier lilies, mountain forget-me-nots and western anemone being the most abundant.

Mule deer frequent the alpine meadows and marmots are found at higher elevations. Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep may be seen in the vicinity of Mount Doolan and near Mount Morro, and mountain goats are seen on the ridges that form the western boundary of the park.<br><br>Birdlife is abundant around Fish Lake. Clark&rsquo;s nutcrackers, Steller&rsquo;s jays, grey jays, varied thrushes and pine grosbeaks inhabit the lake area throughout the summer. Scaups, buffleheads and other waterfowl, including loons, often rest upon the lake; bald eagles and ospreys are seen in the spring when the fish are spawning. Fish Lake, the largest body of water in the park, is noted for its cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden fishery.</li>    </ul>",

The chain is also     part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British     Columbia. With more than 630 kilometres of lakeshore to explore, few developed     facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote     wilderness experience. <br>     <br>A series of small parks have been established along the system providing     protected anchorages or attractive beaches.

The diverse ecosystems in the park remain largely undisturbed by human activity, making this park an ecologically significant area in the province. Chilko Lake, the largest, natural high-elevation freshwater lake in Canada, dominates the park.

This resort provided cabins, camping and boat launch facilities and was very popular with Prince George and Mackenzie residents. In 1974, BC Hydro purchased this property, located within the reservoir basin, because of the possible effect of the Williston Reservoir at maximum full pool flooding. Public demand for maintaining recreational opportunities of this area was so strong that BC Hydro contracted a caretaker to maintain the campground, picnic area and boat launch. During this time public pressure for park development at this site grew and following considerable negotiations, a Provincial Park was established in August, 1981. </li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> There are no known archaeological sites within the vicinity of Tudyah Lake Park. However, it is likely that the area was used by the Sekani Indians for hunting and fishing, with the waterways being used as travel and trade routes.</li>       <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Within the developed areas of the park, opportunities for viewing wildlife are limited. However, in the natural setting along the Pack River, wildlife such as beaver, otter, muskrat, moose, waterfowl and upland birds may be commonly observed. Although less conspicuous other animals expected to inhabit the area include deer, black bear, moose, wolves, coyotes and fox. <br>        <br>Tudyah Lake supports a moderate to highly productive fishery with Rainbow trout and Dolly Varden as the popular sport species.

It has quite a reputation, since over 16 km it loses over4000 feet in elevation. Local residents built it in the 1950s, afterthey had been told by the government of the time that it couldn&rsquo;t be done.However, nowadays it is well-maintained by highways contractors, and,though steep (up to 18% grades), it is passable throughout the year.</p><p>The park can also be reached by way of the Discovery Coast passage ferry from Port Hardy on Vancouver Island, or by float plane from Nimpo Lake, Anahim Lake or Bella Coola, or by hiking in the backcountry.</p><p>You can obtain fuel, basic supplies, and motel accommodation in Anahim Lake or Nimpo Lake. The nearest RCMP office is in Anahim Lake, where there is also a 24-hour medical clinic.

Wallace Houstoun, who first surveyed the area in the 1850s. Twisted fruittrees mark the remnants of the garden and orchard planted by Jeremiah Chivers, a Scotsman who retired here after unsuccessful adventuresin the interior gold rushes. Chivers lived alone on the island, never marrying, and died here in 1927 at the age of 92.         </p>   <p>          After the Second World War, David Conover purchased the island and moved here with his wife Jeanne. The couple developed a very successful holiday resort on Wallace Island, and Conover became a successful author, writing four books &ndash; &ldquo;Once Upon An Island&rdquo;, &ldquo;One Man&rsquo;s Island&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sitting On A Saltspring&rdquo; and &ldquo;Finding Marilyn, A Resource&rdquo;. In the first two books he described the  couple&rsquo;s struggles and joys after their purchase of the land in 1946. Their resort, the Royal Cedar Cottages, was advertised as having &ldquo;a modern well-stocked store, cabins, recreation hall and boat rentals.&rdquo; In the mid to late 1960s, Conover sold the majority of the island to a group of teachers from Seattle. Disagreements among the owners led to court proceedings and the property was again put up for sale. Wallace Island was purchased through the court ordered sale and became a provincial marine park in 1990 through the cooperative efforts of the provincial government and BC Marine Parks Forever.         </p>          </li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The flora of this island is typical of many of the Gulf Islands &ndash; with dry summers, many plants are adapted to germinate and grow in the winter, flower in early spring and become dormant by early summer.

Sightings of river otters, mink and harbour seals are common. Sea lions can be found in the area in winter, but disappear during the height of the breeding season in July and August.

It is accessed via the Ojay Main Road. Follow this road to kilometre 29 and turn right onto the 2500 road (at approximately 25 km) a road that leads to an old well site. The trail starts at the southwest corner of this site. The trail is approximately 19 km and follows the north side of the Wapiti River and the shores of a few smaller lakes. A view of Wapiti Falls can be achieved by following a short 200 metre trail off the main trail at kilometre 7. Be sure to bring your camera, as the scenic views are plentiful.",

      "NatureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> First nations were the earliest people to access this area and have trapped in the Wapiti for many years. In the early 1960s, a local helicopter pilot built the original cabin at the lake. The pilot&rsquo;s cabin eventually succumbed to the ravages of hungry porcupines and time. In the late 1960s, a Catholic Priest prepared a retreat area where spiritual restoration could be obtained. The priest and many others made numerous treks into the solitude of the Wapiti Lake wilderness. In 1983 the BC Forest Service and a Katimivik youth crew upgraded many kilometres of the trail. In 1995 a new cabin was built overlooking the lake. The area was recommended for park status in the Dawson Creek LRMP process and in June 26, 2000 it was established as a Provincial Park.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> First Nations of the Treaty 8 Tribal Association have traditionally used the area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Significant stands of old growth spruce forests blanket the slopes of the Hart Ranges in this part of the Rocky Mountains. Important habitat for numerous large species such as mountain goat and grizzly bear can be found in the park&rsquo;s diverse topography. The park&rsquo;s tributary streams, rivers and lakes contain numerous fish species. Amongst them, and of particular importance provincially, is the bull trout, a blue listed  species. Internationally significant fossils from the Triassic Period have also been uncovered within the park. Fossilized primitive ichthyosaurs found in the  area have been found nowhere else on earth. Examples of other ichthyosaurs found in the Wapiti area have also been found in far off locals such as China and Japan.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> An abundance of wildlife can be viewed in Wapiti Lake Provincial Park. Moose are common ungulates found in the park&rsquo;s many valley bottoms and marshes. Mountain caribou, although less frequently observed, are also found in the park. In the rocky ledges high above the lake, mountain goat can be observed. Both black bear and grizzly bears wander throughout. Wolves, coyotes, lynx and many small mammals pass through or reside in the park.</li>    </ul>",

Historic trails provided access through this area and a traditional cabin still exists at Shea Lake. The Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en continue to use this area.</p><p>The Howson Range has a history of mountaineering dating back to the 1950&rsquo;s, when Rex Gibson, then president of the Alpine Club of Canada, led 3 successive trips to the area. On his fourth trip in 1957, Gibson was attempting to climb Howson Peak with Sterling Hendricks and Don Hubbard. A fall while the party was roped together pulled all three members down the side of the mountain. Gibson died of his injuries before help could arrive.</p><p>The wetlands, meadows, and rich avalanche tracks, combined with the absence of substantive human presence, provide good quality grizzly bear habitat. The alpine and subalpine areas on the east side of the park and beyond provide habitat for the recovering population of northern caribou known as the Telkwa herd, while the terrain around the Howson Range is home to a healthy population of mountain goats. Other species known to use the area include black bear, moose, wolverine, and deer. Burnie Lakes support a diverse fish population including kokanee and mountain whitefish.</p><p>The park also protects whitebark pine communities. Whitebark pine communities are regionally significant because they are at the most northerly extent of their range. Whitebark pine are declining throughout their range due to mountain pine beetle and white pineblister rust. Clark&rsquo;s Nutcrackers are dependent on whitebark pine seeds for survival. Theseeds are also important to other wildlife species, especially grizzly bear.</p>",
