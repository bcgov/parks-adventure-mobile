If you carry on towards middle and upper Joffre Lakes, the trail becomes steeper and more challenging. Evidence of the park&rsquo;s glacial history can be found in the U-shaped valleys, glacial silts and lateral moraines. This magnificent area of jagged peaks, icefields, cold rushing streams and turquoise blue lakes was established as a recreation area in 1988 and became a Class A park in 1996.</p><p>A highlight of the park is the turquoise blue waters of Lower, Middle and Upper Joffre lakes, all three of which are located along the trail, and each more stunning than the last. Their striking, saturated blue colour is caused by &ldquo;rockflour&rdquo; &ndash; or glacial silt &ndash; that is suspended in the water and reflects green and blue wavelengths of sunlight.

The creek is  a<strong> crucial</strong> spawning creek for the Rainbow trout that inhabit Kakwa Lake, and horses crossing along the creek would damage the spawning beds. Horse users please avoid this area with your horses as this area is a source of drinking water for park visitors. The park is a user maintained park, so pack out whatever you have packed into the park. Please cooperate and help to keep the park pristine for future visitors.</li><li>During the summer of 2007 there were two new cabins  constructed at the south end of Kakwa Lake (the old cabins have been removed);  one is open for public use and the other is the park headquarters used by park  rangers and volunteer park hosts. The public cabin is open on a first-come first-serve basis year-round and is open to all park users, this cabin is equipped  with a woodstove, table and bench, accommodations for approximately 10 people with  sleeping platforms and a loft, and a counter with storage underneath the counter top. Please note this cabin doubles as an emergency shelter and warming hut, so please keep it clean and in better shape than found. Please dump gray water into  the pit toilet that is located near the cabin.</li><li></li></ul>",

These studies have documented important ecological baselines, quantified impacts on native species from introduced species, and continues to inform land management through respected academic and civilian science.<br><br>The remote location of <u>K</u>&rsquo;uuna Gwaay Heritage Site/Conservancy provides an excellent opportunity to maintain biological diversity and natural environment values. Of ongoing concern is the presence of introduced mammals. For example, Black-tailed deer, squirrels, Norway rats and raccoons pose a threat to local ecosystems and species. In addition, several non-native invasive plants have been recorded on Limestone Island including burdock, bull thistle, sowthistle, and common crupina.<br><br>The marine foreshore area and marine environment is highly biologically diverse, providing high value habitat for important marine species and includes six harbour seal haulouts and three Stellar sea lion haulouts. Limestone Island is a deposit of pure limestone that consists of massive grey crystalline limestone. South Low Island also has a limestone outcrop. The limestone outcrops on Limestone and South Low islands create unique habitats for rare and endemic plants. The deer-free status of Low and South Low islands allows for vegetation growth that is rarely found elsewhere on Haida Gwaii.<br><br><strong>Established Date:</strong> December 17, 2008<br><br>",

The Adams River has one of the largest Sockeye salmon runs in North America.</p>    <p>     Every fourth year is a &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; salmon run, with millions of fish to be seen (2018 and 2022 will be dominant runs). The Adams River Salmon Society coordinate the celebration known as the &ldquo;Salute to the Sockeye&rdquo; during the dominant years. The following years are &ldquo;sub-dominant&rdquo; runs of sockeye: 2019, 2023. These years often have substantial returns of sockeye and offer excellent viewing opportunities. During the last three weeks of October in years where there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; or &ldquo;sub-dominant&rdquo; return, a small number of salmon begin their spawning cycle. The best place to view spawning salmon is the new viewing platform approximately 300m west of the  parking lot.</p>    <p>     Note that this park does not offer any camping facilities. The 26 km trail system is used for for hiking and mountain biking in summer and cross country skiing and snowshoeing in winter.</p>    <p>     Huihill Creek was recently added to Ts&uacute;tswecw Provincial Park as a result of recommendations made in the Kamloops Land and Resources Management Plan and is now officially a portion of Ts&uacute;tswecw Park.</p>    <p><strong>Special Features: </strong> The Adams River squeezes through a narrow canyon portion of the valley to create spectacular rapids that are enthusiastically used by rafters and kayakers. This park has a beautiful waterfall on Bear Creek that is viewable from the Flume Trail System.</p>    <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> March 21, 1989     <br>     <strong>Park Size</strong>: 1,073 hectares on 11 km of river<br>    </p>",

The park is couched in typical Cariboo ranching country on the southern edge of the Fraser Plateau. This extensive plateau stretches north beyond Lac La Hache, and was formed from lava flows some five to ten million years ago.<br><br> The park was established in 1969, and is a very popular destination for family camping vacations. The park features 25 new lakeside campsites in addition to a large day-use area offering beachside picnic areas and a Big Toy for children. The construction project was funded by FRBC through the Campgrounds BC Initiative, and was completed in the summer of 1999. <br><br>The park&rsquo;s setting is typical of the southern Cariboo. Set against a mountainousbackdrop, the lake is surrounded by lodgepole pine and spruce. Visitors ofBig Bar Lake Park often see wildlife on the 4 km hiking trail surrounding thescenic wetlands, and enjoy angling for rainbow trout in the 3-mile long lake.The area is an extremely popular fishing destination, and is also widely usedby other recreationists. Area attractions include several guest ranches, thetowering Marble Range south of the park, and Gang Ranch country. Visitors canalso travel along the Jesmond Loop, by continuing past Big Bar Lake ProvincialPark, and eventually connecting with Highway 97 by way of the Jesmond and KellyLake Roads. This scenic drive passes by Little Big Bar Lake and the historictownsite of Jesmond, where the OK Corral &ndash; one of the oldest ranches in thearea &ndash; is situated. The loop also accesses the Jesmond fire lookout by wayof a narrow four-wheel drive road, from which visitors can enjoy panoramicviews of the surrounding landscape, including Marble Range and Edge Hills ProvincialParks. Big Bar Lake Park and the surrounding country provide a beautiful settingfor a summer holiday.<br><br> Big Bar Lake Park is easily accessible, and provides a range of recreationalopportunities for outdoor enthusiasts. Some of the major recreational opportunitiesavailable in the park include day-use picnicking, lakeside camping, boating,canoeing and kayaking, swimming, wildlife viewing, hiking, and fishing.Abundant rainbow trout typically reward the angler; fishing is active nearlyall season, but is typically the best between mid May and late July.

The lower Carmanah Valley was declared a provincial park in 1990, and the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys were added in 1995. The park offers protection to diverse forest ecosystems, including a large Sitka spruce ecosystem that represents 2% of BC&rsquo;s remaining old-growth forest.</p><p>Carmanah Walbran is home to some of the world&rsquo;s largest spruce trees, some reaching heights in excess of 95 metres and living for 800 years or more. The park is also home to ancient, gnarled cedars &ndash; estimated to be well over 1,000 years old &ndash; clinging to the side hills. Nestled beneath these awe-inspiring trees is a diverse variety of flora and fauna possible only in an ecosystem that has remained undisturbed for hundreds of years.</p><p>The recent addition of the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys completes the protection of the Carmanah Creek watershed and the southern portion of the Walbran Creek watershed. The park provides unique opportunities for forest research and education in the areas of biodiversity, wildlife and fisheries habitat. It is a majestic forest capable of inspiring all visitors who come here, and offers unforgettable recreational opportunities for hikers and wilderness lovers.</p><p>This coastal fringe of mainly Sitka spruce, with its associated plants and animals, is truly a special place to discover. Sitka spruce forests are typically coast-hugging &ndash; they are rarely found more than 80 kilometres inland and at elevations greater than 30 metres. The park&rsquo;s extensive groves of spruce attain a biomass (weight of plants per hectare) that is nearly twice that of a tropical forest. This dynamic system has developed over thousands of years and functions perfectly if left undisturbed.</p><p>Several hiking trails in the Carmanah Valley provide access to manyof the park&rsquo;s notable natural features, including some of the area&rsquo;s largest trees. Many sections of the trail are extremely muddy and difficult. Be equipped with appropriate clothing (including adequate rain gear) and good hiking boots.</p><p><strong>Date Established:</strong> March 13, 1991 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 16,365 hectares<br></p>",

Here, visitors can enjoy hiking, whale watching, fishing, kayaking, beach camping and more. This vast, untamed wilderness area protects undisturbed watersheds with old-growth forest stands of Sitka spruce, as well as representative coastal and marine ecosystems, including excellent spawning conditions for coho salmon, exposed rocky coasts, sandstone reefs, beaches,  sheltered channels and bays, fast narrows, mudflats and shallow banks.</p>    <p>One of the main attractions of Flores Island is the &ldquo;Walk the Wild Side Trail,&rdquo; a route that extends 10 km from the village of Ahousat to Cow Bay. First Nation peoples have used this route for centuries to reach the wild beaches on the west side of the island, and this vital circuit can now be explored by park visitors. Most of the route follows sandy beaches, and trails cut across headlands to join with the next beach. Muddy and slippery sections are present on this route, at this time.</p>    <p>The park offers excellent opportunities to see Gray whales, who pass by the Island in their annual migration from Baja California to Alaska. Seasonally resident Gray whales also use the bays for feeding during the summer. Visitors come from around the world to see the whales and kayak the waters in Clayoquot Sound, and a trip to the area would not be complete without discovering all that beautiful Flores Island has to offer.</p>    <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> July 12, 1995     <br>     <strong>Park Size</strong>: 7,113 hectares (4,144 ha upland, 2,969 ha foreshore)<br>     </p>",

It remained as the main northern access route until 1920 when it became obsolete with the construction of a road from Prince George to Summit Lake.    </p>    <p>     <strong>Established Date:</strong> April 18, 2001<br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 160 Hectares    </p>",

There&rsquo;s something new, different and exciting every month of the year at Goldstream Park.</p><p>Goldstream&rsquo;s numerous trails criss-cross through the dramatically different terrain of two distinct vegetation zones. The park is home to 600-year-old Douglas fir trees and western red cedar, mixed with western yew and hemlock, red alder, big leaf maple and black cottonwood. On the drier ridges visitors can find flowering dogwood, lodgepole pine and arbutus. The arbutus, with its thick leathery evergreen leaves, red-dish trunk and peeling bark, is Canada&rsquo;s only broad-leafed evergreen and is found exclusively on Vancouver Island and on the southwest coast of British Columbia. In the spring and early summer, Goldstream overflows with colourful wildflowers, including the shade-loving western trillium and the calypso, a delicate orchid of the mossy forest glades.</p><p>Trails range from easy, wheelchair-accessible walks to strenuous hikes and track along creeks, through forested uplands and past abandoned gold diggings from the days of the Gold Rush. More adventurous hikers can climb to the top of one of the highest points in Greater Victoria &ndash; Mount Finlayson, a recent addition to the park in 1994. Another trail leads you to stunning Niagara Falls, which cascades 47.5 metres down a rock cliff into a crystal clear canyon pool below.</p><p>The park is also the site of an annual chum salmon spawning run, which draws thousands of salmon &ndash; and visitors &ndash; every year. Riverside trails and observation platforms provide extraordinary opportunities to view this natural phenomenon, which also attracts Bald eagles, who swoop down to devour the bodies of the spawned out salmon.</p><p>Park naturalists are available at the Freeman King Visitor Center, which offers interpretive programs and informative lectures about the area&rsquo;s natural history for individuals and groups. The park also features a large picnic area with shelters, as well as vehicle accessible camping and group sites.</p><p>For your convenience during the summer season, this park has a small concession managed by the park operator.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> June 26, 1958<br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 477 hectares (454 ha upland, 23 ha foreshore)</p><h4> Special Features </h4><ul><li>Goldstream Park is home to waterfalls, including <strong>Niagara Falls</strong>, which at 47.5 metres is almost at high as its famous namesake, and <strong>Goldstream Falls</strong>, a small waterfall located in the southwest corner of the park near the campground.</li><li>Goldstream is also part of the Nanaimo Lowlands Ecosection and the Coastal Douglas Fir Biogeoclimatic Zone.

At Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park you can experience the magic of the underground world in the many caves protected within this unique park.

For those that prefer their adventures above-ground, the park also offers a Cave &amp; Karst Education Centre that features geology information, a small museum and fossil display in addition to Canada’s only Cave Theatre, so visitors can learn more about this unique environment without having to venture underground. Other above-ground opportunities include a self-guided walk through the amazing surface geology on the &ldquo;Phil Whitfield Interpretive Trail&rdquo; that highlights interesting surface features detailed in a self-guiding brochure.</p><p>Spelunking is the art of cave exploration and Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park is the perfect place to discover this unique activity. From educational family-oriented tours to deep, dark adventure, the caves protected within this park offer something for everyone. Knowledgeable guides can lead visitors  through the caves to discover this magical world of crystal formations and ancient fossils firsthand. Though the park has two small caves visitors can explore on their own, a guided tour of one of the larger caves offers more variety and a chance to learn about the cave&rsquo;s unique geology and history.</p><p>Whichever method of exploring the caves you choose, you are bound to be fascinated by this amazing underground world in the heart of Vancouver Island. <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 158 hectares <br><strong>Date Established:</strong> January 26, 1971</p>",

At the end of the last ice age, some 11,000 years ago, winds from the main trench of the Fraser River and from, what is now, Kinbasket Lake, deposited vast quantities of sand in the Jackman Flats area. This created an ecosystem considered unique in  British Columbia. Rare plant communities and shifting sand dune structures now exist in this rather small park.<br>     <br>Excellent recreational opportunities have been enjoyed by Robson Valley residents for many years in this special area. Unregulated motorized use, primarily from all terrain vehicles, has had a devastating effect on not only the rare plant communities but on the structural integrity of the sand dunes.  The uniqueness of Jackman Flats can be quickly appreciated when one considers that one plant community, Juniperus-Stereocaulon, is found nowhere else in British Columbia.<br>     <br>An extremely dry area, where drought conditions generally exist through the summer season, Jackman Flats is vulnerable to excessive recreation use. Hiking, and cross-country skiing are permitted on existing trails only. Excellent opportunities exist for bird watching and plant identification. The parks most prominent residents are the variety of lichen species that dominate the landscape. The fragile nature, distribution and abundance of these lichens can be preserved by staying on designated trails. Remember, to collect or damage any natural object in a provincial park is illegal.

The area is protected most notably because of its importance to an internationally significant herd of California bighorn sheep.<br>     <br>     To learn more about conservation efforts to preserve the values in this park, click to view <a href=\"http://www.ccconserv.org\" target=\"_blank\">Cariboo Chilcotin Conservation Society&rsquo;s webpage</a> [non-government website].<br><br><strong>Established Date:</strong> July 12, 1995<br>     <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 4,774 hectares <br>     <br><strong>Special Notes:</strong>     <ul>   <li>Camping is not permitted in the Junction Sheep Range Provincial Park or on the private property of Riske Creek Ranching.</li>       <li>Obey park closures.

A management      agreement was signed in 1998 between the two parties and stablished a Park Management Board that oversees any issues related      to the management, conservation, recreational and cultural heritage      objectives for the area.     </p>     <p>      <em>Say Nuth Khaw Yum</em> means &ldquo;Serpent&rsquo;s      Land.&rdquo; It is in the core of Tsleil-Waututh traditional territory      that has from time out of mind been an area of significance to the Tsleil-Waututh      people.&nbsp; For over a millenium, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation has continued      to use the land, water and resources of the entire area of Indian Arm.     </p>     <p>      Say Nuth Khaw Yum Provincial Park [aka Indian Arm Park] is a conservation      park that protects the shores of Indian Arm, an 18 kilometre fjord that      extends north from Burrard Inlet in Vancouver. The park area was once      heavily glaciated, leaving behind a spectacular landscape featuring      rugged, forested mountains, several alpine lakes, and numerous creeks      and waterfalls, including the 50-metre high Granite Falls. The park      also includes Racoon and Twin Islands, both characterized by sparse      vegetation, open cover, and exposed rocky ledges.The park offers a variety      of recreation activities.     </p>     <p>Indian Arm is ideal for motor boating, kayaking,      canoeing, and scuba diving. Indian River and the lower reaches of some      creeks are perfect for recreational fishing. The old-growth forested      mountains provide opportunities for hiking, wildlife viewing and nature      appreciation, while the flat beach areas along the shorelines of Bishop      Creek provide opportunities for rustic camping, picnicking and other      day-use activities.

Smaller numbers of Coho and Chinook salmon find their way back to the      Indian River each year.

Sitting mostly above 1,800 metres in elevation, the park has two glaciers &ndash; Kokanee and Woodbury &ndash; which feed over 30 lakes and are the headwaters of many creeks.</p>     <p>Kokanee Lake is 1,200 metres in length and 400 metres wide; surrounded by precipitous cliffs and rock slides, it is an alpine jewel. Other scenic lakes in the park include the gem-coloured Sapphire Lakes, milky Joker Lakes and popular Gibson, Kaslo and Tanal Lakes, which offer good fishing for    rainbow and cutthroat trout. With 85 km of well-marked trails, this park is appropriate for campers, hikers and climbers with all levels of outdoor    experience.</p>     <p>Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, set aside in 1922, is one of the oldest major parks in the provincial system. It has a long history of well established recreational use and is perhaps the best known alpine park in the Kootenay area of British Columbia. Its boundaries encompass 32,035 hectares of some of the most scenic mountain country found in the Selkirk Mountains of southern British  Columbia, comprising a picturesque mosaic of high peaks, snowfields, cirques and colourful lake basins.</p>     <p>As the dominant feature and roughly in the park&rsquo;s centre, Kokanee Glacier forms the culmination of mountain ridges and valleys leading in from Kootenay and Slocan Lake. Slowly regenerating burns, old growth spruce stands, open slide paths and meadowlands lend contrast and heighten the beauty of the Park&rsquo;s mountain landscape.</p>     <p>Access to the park was developed from old mining and forestry roads. Leading from these various road ends, trails dating to the early mining developments offer a variety of hiking opportunities ranging from short day trips to challenging cross-country routes; for the status of the main access routes please <a href=\"trail_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Check the most recent trail report <span class=\"fileinfo\">[PDF]</span></a>. Historical cabins and interesting old mine sites combine with many natural features including peaks, lakes and alpine basins to form a rich and diverse environment for back-country recreation.</p>     <p>The park straddles the crest of mountain ridges between Slocan Lake and Kootenay Lake. Located 30 kilometres to the northeast, the peaks of Kokanee  Glacier are visible from the city of Nelson, and stand out as dominant skyline features from many points on Kootenay Lake.</p>     <p>Weather patterns in the park are typical of the Southern Interior Mountains, With the whole Park area over 1,500 metres, elevation strongly influences weather conditions and while warm spells occur in July and August, Park visitors should be aware of the highly changeable nature of mountain weather. Snow and sleet are not uncommon in summer, and rainy weather, many times in the form of thunderstorms, can be expected in the spring, summer and autumn months.</p>     <p>The heavy snowfall accumulations in the Park can be counted upon to ensure excellent ski conditions from late autumn to early spring. Snow can occur in October at all levels in the Park and the higher elevations are not likely to be snow-free until July. Avalanches are prevalent on the open alpine slope, limiting ski touring possibilities to certain routes and to low risk periods.</p>     <p><strong>Date Established: </strong>February 6, 1922      <br>      <strong>Park Size:</strong> 32,035 hectares     </p>",

Set amongst a stately Douglas-fir forest, the cool, green conifers shade campers from the hot Cariboo sun. Lac La Hache Park is located on Highway 97, 13 km north of the community of Lac La Hache. Established in 1956, with 83 campsites, flush toilets, tap water, a sani-station and a self-guided nature trail, Lac La Hache Park is a very pleasant campground. The day-use area is located across Highway 97 on the shore of Lac La Hache and has an adventure playground, picnic tables, picnic shelter, boat launch, developed beach, changehouse and flush toilets.    </p>    <p>     This is an excellent fishing lake for Kokanee and lake trout, as well as rainbow trout and burbot during the summer months. However, fishing need not be your only recreational pursuit, as the lake is also a popular place for power boating and water-skiing.    </p>    <p>     The Heritage House at 108 Mile is a half-hour&rsquo;s drive from the campground, and is open from May to September. The campground host or <a href=\"#contact\">Park Operator</a> can inform you of other things to do in the area, as well as boat rental locations. The community of Lac La Hache offers a grocery store, gas station, bakery, ice cream parlour and a few restaurants.    </p>    <p>     <strong>Established Date:</strong> March 16, 1956<br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 24 hectares    </p>    <table class=\"hours\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\">     <tr><th colspan=\"2\"> Campground Dates of Operation<div class=\"note\">All dates are subject to change without notice</div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"40%\"><strong>Opening and Closing Campground Dates:</strong><br>(campground is accessible but may not offer full services such as water,security, etc.) </td><td width=\"60%\">May 15 &ndash; September 30(gate is closed during off-season but access to boat launch until October11) </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Campground Dates with Full Services and Fees:</strong> </td><td>May 15 &ndash; September 30</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Campground Reservable Dates:</strong> </td><td>May 15 &ndash; September 3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Number of Vehicle Accessible Campsites: </strong></td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of Reservable Campsites, if applicable:</strong><br>(all remaining sites are first-come, first-served) </td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Note:</strong> The above information isfor the campground only.

Here visitors can stroll through a network of trails under the shadow of towering ancient Douglas-fir trees, majestic pillars untouched by the modern world &ndash; some more than 800 years old.     </p>     <p>     Trails on either side of the highway lead visitors through the mighty stands of this coastal forest. On the south side you will find the largest Douglas firs &ndash; one measuring more than 9 metres in circumference. On the northern side of the road you&rsquo;ll find groves of ancient Western red cedar standing sentry over nearby Cameron Lake.     </p>     <p>     The park has been restoring some of its trails after a severe windstorm on New Year&rsquo;s Day in 1997, which changed the look of the park forever. The storm toppled hundreds of huge trees and obliterated sections of the trail system. Some sections of the trail system were so badly hit that they have never been reopened. Restoration and cleanup began almost as soon as the winds stopped, and although visitors will now find many of these huge trees lying on the ground, their value has not diminished. These fallen trees open the canopy to provide light, space, shelter and nutrients for the next generations of plants. Natural regeneration is beginning to restore the Grove&rsquo;s pristine beauty and the park&rsquo;s diversity, making a visit to Cathedral Grove all the more intriguing.     </p>     <p>     Improvements to MacMillan Park can be supported by &ldquo;feeding&rdquo; the donation tree next to the main trail; your contributions will be used for youth team trail projects, volunteer projects, revegetation projects and new signs.

Please stay on designated trails, where you will find ample opportunities to view and photograph this bit of history.     </p>     <p>     <strong>Special Features:</strong> The park protects and preserves an internationally significant representative example of Douglas fir old-growth forest within the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone.     </p>     <p>     <strong>Established Date:</strong> February 27, 1947<br>     <strong>Park Size: </strong>301 hectares     </p>",

All sedentary marine life, including abalones,  scallops and sea cucumbers, are fully protected within the park&rsquo;s boundaries, which extend 300 metres out from the shore. This nature reserve is an important nesting colony for thousands of Glaucous-winged Gulls, as well as Pelagic Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemots, Black Oystercatchers and many other species of birds. Marine life around the island includes river otters and harbour seals throughout the year, and Steller&rsquo;s and California sea lions from late fall through to summer.<br><br>Mitlenatch, which means &ldquo;calm waters all around&rdquo; in the Coast Salish language, is a small rocky island that features semi-arid conditions caused by the island&rsquo;s location in the &ldquo;rain shadow&rdquo; of Vancouver Island. The park receives less than 75 cm (30 inches) of rain each year &ndash; about half the Campbell River average. Rain-bearing clouds pass eastward from the Pacific Ocean and drop much of their moisture on Vancouver Island. As they descend across the Strait of Georgia, they warm and pick up new moisture, which will be dropped on the Coast Mountains of mainland British Columbia.<br><br>Accessible by boat only, Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park offers excellent opportunities to observe and photograph wildflowers and birds. Visit in May when the island&rsquo;s meadows of spring wildflowers are in bloom, or in late May to July when the harvest brodia blooms and in the last half of June when the coastal cactus bloom. Birders should approach the observation blind as a group, slowly and quietly, this may help to reduce the birds&rsquo; anxiety and allow you to observe their behaviour and &ldquo;family life&rdquo; more easily.<br><br>The island is a very sensitive ecosystem that is extremely prone to damage by visitors who venture off the designated trails. Pets are not permitted on the island.<br><br>Collecting of any kind is NOT permitted at Mitlenatch Island, including all shellfish.<br><br>",

White shell beaches, open meadows, tidal lagoons, towering forests, craggy headlands and abundant bird life are just a few of the things that attract visitors to this park in the southern Gulf Islands.</p>     <p>The park starts five metres below sea level and climbs 180 metres to a steep rocky precipice. Visitors can moor their boats to one of the 35 buoys in sheltered Montague Harbour or come by ferry and camp in one of the scenic vehicle-accessible or walk-in campsites. The park is the perfect place to enjoy a picnic or afternoon of exploration. Located within the park is Gray Peninsula, which was inhabited by First Nations peoples before the arrival of Spanish explorer Dionisio Galiano in 1792. Skirting the northwest edge of the peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers thousands of years ago.</p>     <p>Montague Harbour, with its sheltered waters and abundant salmon and shellfish, is heir to a rich history. The white shell beach on the north side of the park marks one of several shell middens &ndash; evidence of native occupation dating back more than 3,000 years. Castaway shells left by centuries of harvesting form berms on the foreshore in many areas of the park. Wave action erodes the middens, crushes the shells and redeposits them to create Montague&rsquo;s white shell beaches. Archaeological excavations of these protected middens have unearthed arrows, spearheads and stone carvings, helping to unravel the stories of earlier cultures.</p>     <p>Montague Harbour is a delight for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers in any season, but particularly during the long hot days of summer. Naturalists and bird watchers enjoy a climate and ecology found nowhere else, making Galiano Island a haven for many rare and protected plants and more than 130 species of birds. The waters around Montague Harbour attract flocks of wintering birds including diving ducks like scoters, buffleheads, goldeneyes and mergansers.</p>     <p><strong>Special Features:</strong>    On the northwest edge of Gray Peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers thousands of years ago. The park also features a salt water marsh between the main campground and Gray Peninsula, and evidence of First Nations culture that dates back more than 3,000 years.

The area was proposed for protection through the Cariboo public CORE process, and was originally designated a park through the Cariboo Chilcotin Land Use Plan in 1995. The park protects a chain of 12  small lakes, popular as a day or overnight canoeing destination. It is an idyllic place to visit, rewarding paddlers with clear, shallow lakes and abundant aquatic plants and flowers. The many tiny reed-fringed islands and surrounding marshes provide excellent habitat for deer, moose, waterfowl and amphibians.<br>     <br>Stuart Maitland, a local guide outfitter, first cleared and named portages linking the main lakes in the <a href=\"canoe.html\">Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a> in the early 1970s, with assistance from Hugh Kirkland and Kevin Marks. These three ambitious young men were in their late teens at the time, and independently sought government assistance to do the work. Today, the three main lakes in the chain are named after the youth who first developed the route. The route was later upgraded in 1987/88 by youth members of the Provincial Job Trac program.<br>     <br>The park is a wonderful place to spend leisure time canoeing, bird-watching, and wildlife viewing. Canoeing along the <a href=\"canoe.html\">Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a> is the primary recreational activity, and both day and overnight trips are popular. Camping areas are available at either end of the canoe route, but the only developed sites are located at the main access point at Marks Lake and at the north end of Maitland Lake. While the 1100 Road into Moose Valley isn&rsquo;t maintained in winter, the area is still a haven for cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing. A local outfitter offers one to two-day dog sled tours in the winter and guided canoe trips in the park.<br>     <br><strong>Special Features</strong>: Wetlands and sphagnum bogs can be accessed and viewed via canoe.<br>     <br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 2,500 hectares",

This remote park showcases a spectacular volcanic landscape that includes lava flows, basalt plateaus, cinder fields and cinder cones. At an elevation of 2,787 metres, Mount Edziza is an outstanding feature of this rugged and arresting domain.</p>     <p>Mount Edziza, whose peak reaches 2,787 metres, is a composite volcano consisting of thin basalt flows and a central dome of andesite, dacite and rhyolite with a glaciated crater nearly 2,500 metres in diameter. The eruption that built the mountain and its central cone began four million years ago. Successive lava flows raised the dome above the encircling plateau and spread lava over an area 65 kilometres by 25 kilometres. The last basalt flow occurred only 10,000 years ago, at which time it solidified in place and plugged the central vent.</p>     <p>In the years since Mount Edziza became dormant, numerous small eruptions have taken place around it, creating more than 30 cinder cones. Perfectly symmetrical Eve Cone rises 150 metres above the plateau, as do aptly named Coffee and Cocoa craters. It is estimated that these cones were formed no more than 1,300 years ago and are basically unaltered by erosion and devoid of vegetation.</p>     <p>There are also five significant lakes within the park. Mowdade, Mowchilla, Kakiddi and Nuttlude form a chain along the eastern boundary, while Buckley Lake is on the northern border. All the lakes except Mowdade drain north into the Klastine River, a tributary of the Stikine.</p>     <p>To the south, Raspberry Pass separates the Edziza area from the Spectrum Range. Formed from lava flows, these mountains are named for their brilliant red, yellow, white and purple rock.This altered rhyolite resulted from staining by sulphurous mineral waters. Subsequent erosion has resulted in the combination of many hues, giving the landscape the appearance of a vast water colour. There is no vehicle access to Mount Edziza Provincial Park, and there are only a very few basic facilities.

The mountain for which the park is named guards the park&rsquo;s western entrance. At 3,954 metres, Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, towers over the lesser surrounding peaks; winter or summer, this is one of the finest&nbsp;views in the Rocky Mountains. Just as the early trappers, hunters and explorers felt in awe at the mountain&rsquo;s magnificence, travellers today experience the same feelings.</p><p>With Alberta&rsquo;s Jasper National Park as its easterly neighbour, Mount Robson Provincial Park comprises a portion of one of the world&rsquo;s largest blocks of protected areas. Designated as a part of the <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/304.htm\">Canadian Rocky Mountains World Heritage Site</a> by UNESCO in 1990, Mount Robson provides everything from developed, vehicle-accessible camping to remote valleys that seldom see a human footprint. Mount Robson Provincial Park also protects the headwaters of the Fraser River. From its pristine alpine source, the Fraser River gains strength and size to match any of the world&rsquo;s major rivers. Future genations will surely appreciate the protection of this great river&rsquo;s source within Mount Robson Park.</p><p>Flora and fauna are typical of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, North Continental Range. One is able, on some trails, to travel between three different vegetation zones during a day hike. Over 182 species of birds have been documented in the park. All wildlife indigenous in the Rocky Mountain can be found here. Mule and Whitetail Deer, Moose, Elk and Black Bear call the lower elevation home while Grizzly Bear, Caribou, Mountain Goat and Mountain Sheep inhabit the higher elevations. With over 217,000 hectares of mostly undisturbed wilderness available, wildlife populations are allowed to ebb and flow with minimal intervention by humans. There are excellent wildlife viewing opportunities throughout the park. From mountain goats on the many cliffs and rockslides to moose in Moose Marsh, the patient observer will be suitably rewarded.</p><p>First attemptedin 1907, it was not until 1913 that humans finally stood onthe summit of Mount Robson. On that clear, cold day guide ConradKain, W.W. Foster and A.H. McCarthy beheld a view no personhad ever seen before.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> March 11, 1913 <br><strong>Total Size:</strong> 225,777 hectares (Park: 225,285 hectares; Protected Areas: 492 hectares)</p><p>For 20 years, the Mountain Legacy Project (MLP), based today in the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, has been using repeat photography to examine, analyze, and understand landscape level change in the Canadian mountain west. Mt. Robson Provincial Park, with over 3 kilometres of elevation change from the valley of the Fraser River (approximately 800 m.) to the summit of Mt. Robson (3954 m), and four biogeoclimatic zones, represents a series of interconnected complex mountain ecosystems perfect for landscape level analysis. This park, with an area of roughly 2,250 km², may appear imperishable, but change is evident. Using reference photographs taken in 1911 by Arthur Wheeler, MLP teams went out in the field 100 years later to retake the images from exactly the same locations. All of the historic/modern image pairs so far completed can be seen online at <a href=\"http://explore.mountainlegacy.ca/\">explore.mountainlegacy.ca</a>. A selected group of image pairs were further segmented into land cover classifications and analyzed for change. The results, including some interesting interactive change visualizations, are available at the <a href=\"https://robsonlandscape.weebly.com/\">Visualizing 100 Years of Landscape Change website</a>.This work was completed in part through funding provided through the BC Parks <a href=\"/partnerships/living-labs/\">Living Lab for Climate Change and Conservation Program</a>.</p>",

Bring your own boat or take the passenger ferry from Nanaimo&mdash;a 10 minute ride that deposits passengers on Newcastle Island, located just a few hundred metres offshore from Vancouver Island. From a distance you&rsquo;ll see an island shoreline dominated by steep sandstone cliffs and ledges, interspersed with sunny beaches &ndash; a marked contrast to the interior of the island, which is studded with mature Douglas fir, Garry oak, arbutus and Big Leaf maple trees.</p><p>Visitors to Newcastle Island can choose from an extensive network of walking/hiking trails that lead to various historic points around the island. Indigenous middens offer mute evidence of at least two Salish villages, which were deserted before the discovery of coal in this area in 1849. Subsequent decades saw the island&rsquo;s fortunes rise and fall as it went through various incarnations while supporting a fish-salting operation, a sandstone quarry and a shipyard.</p><p>In 1931 the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company purchased the island and operated it as a pleasure resort, building a dance pavilion &ndash; now the visitor center &ndash; a teahouse, picnic areas, change houses, a soccer field and a wading pool. An old ship was tied to the dock at Mark Bay and served as a floating hotel. The island became very popular for company picnics and Sunday outings, with ships from Vancouver bringing as many as 1,500 people at a time. The advent of the Second World War, however, caused a decrease in the number of ships available for pleasure excursions and Newcastle Island suffered a consequent decline in popularity.</p><p>Today, park services and facilities include walk-in campsites complete with flush toilets and showers, as well as facilities for group camping and  picnicking. The Pavilion can also be rented for dances, corporate picnics and wedding receptions.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> October 17, 1961<br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 363 hectares (334 hectares of upland and 29 hectares of foreshore)</p><h5>Special Notes</h5><ul><li>A park interpreter is in attendance during the summer to provide visitor information and to interpret the island&rsquo;s unique human and natural history.

In May and June of each year, approximately 15,000 to 25,000 wild rainbow trout move up from Pennask Lake to spawn in Pennask Creek. Each year, two million eggs are removed from 10% of the spawning female trout and sent to the Summerland Trout Hatchery to be raised. Once raised, these fish are then used for stocking rainbow trout throughout the province. There are four known archaeologicalsites in the protected area and one blue-listed variety of willow shrub, salix boothii.</p>     <p><strong>Park Size:</strong> 1,243 hectares<br>     <strong>Date Established:</strong> April 18, 2001 </p>",

Visitors can get a glimpse back to a time more than 1,000 years ago, when First Nations peoples created these traditional carvings. This day-use park offers excellent viewing opportunities of these petroglyphs. Locations for rock art carvings were chosen carefully, and were almost always made at places of power or mystery &ndash; places where the forces of nature were believed to be especially strong. These areas are usually marked by natural features such as waterfalls, rock formations or caves, and most are near water.<br>     <br>A short walkway leads from the parking lot to an interpretive area with information boards that offer details about the history of the area and help to decipher the petroglyphs. The images &ndash; depicting everything from mystical wolf-like creatures to fish and human figures &ndash; were made for a variety of reasons, including territorial ownership and to commemorate special events among a people with no written language. The sandstone gallery of petroglyphs, located on a hill overlooking Nanaimo Harbour, is just a short distance from the interpretive area along the walkway.<br>     <br>Concrete replica castings of the petroglyphs can be found in the main interpretation area. Here, visitors can make rubbings of the castings by stretching cloth or paper across the carving and lightly rubbing with a crayon, charcoal or wax, which leaves a reverse imprint.

A mixture of forest, field and shore habitats makes it one of the most productive wildlife viewing areas on Salt Spring Island. Watch for sea lions and killer whales out in the sea, and mink and river otter cavorting along the shoreline. Tidal pools are filled with a brightly-coloured world of crab, mussel, limpet, oyster, sculpin, starfish and more.</p><p>Scuba divers frequent the waters off Ruckle Park, drifting among the castle-like caves or floating above the bountiful ocean floor, where they will find a profusion of Plumose anemones, sponges, nudibranchs, octopuses, seastars and giant barnacles. On shore, birdwatchers can often catch sight of cormorants, grebes, guillemots, eagles, grouse or quail.</p><p>In addition to its natural beauty, Ruckle Park is an area rich in cultural history. Irish emigrant Henry Ruckle first homesteaded here in 1872, marrying Ella Anna Christensen in 1877. Their descendants have farmed the Salt Spring property for more than a century. The Ruckle family donated their land to BC Parks in 1972 for the creation of Ruckle Provincial Park. The family still operates the Active Farm area of Ruckle Park and maintains several residences through a Life Tenancy Agreement established with BC Parks at the time of the donation.<br></p>",

Located almost in the centre of Vancouver Island, Strathcona park is a rugged mountain wilderness comprising more than 250,000 hectares. Mountain peaks &ndash; some perpetually mantled with snow &ndash; dominate the park. Lakes and alpine tarns dot a landscape laced with rivers, creeks and streams. Summer in Strathcona is usually pleasantly warm, while winters are fairly mild except for the higher levels, where heavy snowfalls are the norm. From November through March, snowfalls can be expected on the mountain slopes and alpine plateaus. Snow remains all year on the mountain peaks and may linger into July even at moderate elevations. Summer evenings, as elsewhere in the coastal regions of B.C., can be cool and rain can be expected at any time of the year.</p><p>Two areas &ndash; Buttle Lake and vicinity, and Forbidden Plateau &ndash; offer a variety of visitor-oriented developments. The rest of the park is largely undeveloped and appeals primarily to people seeking wilderness surroundings. To see and enjoy much of the scenic splendor requires hiking or backpacking into the alpine regions.</p><p>Buttle Lake, named for Commander John Buttle who explored the area in the 1860s, is the major body of water in the park. It and many other lakes and waterways in the park can provide good fishing in season for Cutthroat, Rainbow and Dolly Varden trout. Della Falls, whose drop of 440 metres over three cascades makes it one of the highest waterfalls in Canada, is located in the southern remote section of the park with the trailhead only accessible by boat at the northwest end of Great Central Lake. And the highest point on Vancouver Island, the Golden Hinde (elevation 2,200 metres), stands almost in the centre of Strathcona to the west of Buttle Lake.</p><p>Three roadless tracts within Strathcon Provincial Park &ndash; Big Den, Central Strathcona and Comox Glacier--have been designated as nature conservancy areas. Each tract contains outstanding examples of scenery and natural history that remain uninfluenced by human activity. The three areas, totalling 122,500 hectares, are dedicated to the preservation of the undisturbed natural environment.</p><p>While the high mountain peaks and deep shaded valleys of Strathcona Park are dramatic, it is easy to forget that beneath your feet lays a history stretching back 380 million years. It is a history of violent volcanic eruptions on ancient seafloors and quiet interludes when gardens of sea lilies waved in gentle ocean currents. It is a history of rocks torn and folded by the extraordinary forces that can move continents, and of mountain ranges sculpted by the immensely thick ice sheets, which only vanished a few thousand years ago. No matter how long your visit, or whatever your interest, a knowledge of the <a href=\"http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/MINING/GEOSCIENCE/PUBLICATIONSCATALOGUE/INFORMATIONCIRCULARS/IC1995-07/Pages/GeologicalHistory.aspx\">geology of Strathcona Park</a> will enhance your enjoyment of this spectacularly beautiful area.</p><p>Strathcona Park benefits from excellent adjoining commercial facilities such as the Strathcona Park Lodge and Outdoor Education Centre, which offers outdoor education and wilderness skills training. The nearby communities of Campbell River, the Comox Valley, Gold River, Tofino and Port Alberni offer a full range of visitor services. Mount Washington Alpine Resort, located adjacent to the park, offers extensive alpine and nordic skiing opportunities, as well as a variety of winter and summer recreation facilities.</p><p>The <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/strath_mt/\">Megin-Talbot addition</a> in Strathcona Provincial Park was identified for protection in the Clayoquot Sound Land-Use  Decision in 1995.</p><p><strong>Date Established:</strong> March 1, 1911 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 248,669 hectares (247,961 hectares of upland and 708 hectares of foreshore)</p>",

Tatshenshini-Alsek Park contains nearly one million hectares of glacier-cloaked peaks, wild rivers, grizzly bears and unusual plant  communities. Situated in the very northwest corner of British Columbia, it nestles between Kluane National Park and Reserves in the Yukon and Glacier Bay  &amp; Wrangell-St. Elias National Parks and Preserves in Alaska. Combined, these parks comprise the largest protected area in the world, approximately 8.5  million hectares. The Tatshenshini-Alsek Park has been designated as a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/72.htm\" target=\"_blank\">World Heritage Site</a> by UNESCO. The  Alsek and Tatshenshini rivers are responsible for much of what&rsquo;s special in the area. The great gap they&rsquo;ve carved through the coastal mountains allows cool, moist ocean air into the cold interior. The quick change from ocean to interior environment, frequent floods, landslides and avalanches, a varied geology and great elevation changes have together created an exceptionally diverse range of habitat conditions.</p>    <p>     Despite its remote location the ruggedly beautiful Tatshenshini-Alsek region is attracting an increasing number of recreationalists: <a href=\"rafting_kayaking.html\" target=\"_blank\">kayakers and rafters</a> are drawn to the two magnificent river systems; <a href=\"hiking_biking.html\" target=\"_blank\">hikers</a> and mountaineers confront a near-endless pristine wilderness that includes everything from alpine  meadows to the jagged edges of the Alsek Ranges and Mt. Fairweather, the province&rsquo;s highest peak at 4,633 metres; and <a href=\"hiking_biking.html\" target=\"_blank\">mountain bikers</a> can explore old mining roads and other interesting and challenging terrain. Interestingly, the Haines Highway provides an opportunity to see much of the same unusual plant and animal diversity that river users experience.</p>    <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> October 15, 1993     <br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 947,026 hectares<br>    </p>",

The river,     designated as a Provincial Heritage River, is 22 kilometres long and navigable.     At 96 kilometres in length, Takla is the fifth largest lake in the province.     Almost 250 kilometres of undisturbed shoreline with sandy beaches and isolated     bays are available to explore. There are three marine park sites on Takla     Lake.

The diversity and contrast in landscapes and vegetation are a result of a rainshadow effect on the east side of the mountains. While the northern and eastern portions of the park are relatively dry, the south end of Chilko Lake is characterized by moist areas of the coastal western hemlock zone.</p><p>The provincial park was established in February of 1994 as a wilderness area set aside to protect vegetation, wildlife and fish habitats, cultural values, and special features. The diverse ecosystems in the park remain largely undisturbed by human activity, making this park an ecologically significant area in the province. Chilko Lake, the largest, natural high-elevation freshwater lake in Canada, dominates the park. Stunningly beautiful, due to its blue-green hues and dramatic mountain backdrops, Chilko Lake is popular with boaters, kayakers, and anglers.
